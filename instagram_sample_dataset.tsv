B9B4GrEHamf	💆 What is one item many of us use in our beauty regime daily? Single-use cotton pads.⠀. ⠀. We often use cotton pads to put on our toner or with make-up remover to take off make-up.⠀. ⠀. Cotton requires a large amount of pesticide and water to produce. Pesticides deplete soil quality and as a result, leach into water systems, affecting animals and people living near cotton farms. In addition, an overwhelming 20,000 litres of water is needed to produce only 1kg of cotton, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF).⠀. ⠀. That’s a lot of resources consumed for a single-use product!⠀. ⠀. But, don’t worry! Reducing the environmental impact of cotton is simple. You can easily replace single-use cotton pads with reusable ones. Alternatively, you could pour your toner into spray bottles, avoiding the cotton altogether!⠀. ⠀.

B8-jGv2H8yf	*Some sushi, anyone?*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Ohai everyone! I’m posting this from Nagano today; we took the Shinkansen 🚅 from Tokyo yesterday, amidst the discomfort of suspected food poisoning 🤢 and crashed at 9 last night after a dinner of clear broth and pho. I don’t feel I’m ready for food yet, which is a shame because the food in Japan is really good. We did a couple of walk-ins and have not been disappointed. It’s 1pm now and so far I’ve had some coffee, half a sandwich, and a third of an apple (that a shopkeeper at Obuse gave me, where we bought some “special” dried shitake mushrooms that you need to pre-soak for 30 hours in the fridge).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I thought I’d share my (well, @njingyi’s) sushi snack baggie since 🍣 and 🇯🇵. And repost @meiangiez’s sushi coffee cup strap. They look awesome as a matchy set. I’ve been on the hunt for more sushi prints  but haven’t found any; how ironic that this lovely sushi print is from the US?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Ha r a lovely Tuesday and I’ll post more on stories later 🍣💛🇯🇵🚅. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbaggie #reusablebag #reusablesnackbag #reusablefoodbag #reusablesandwichbag #reusablecoffeecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeetogo #coffeeonthego #zerowastecoffee #reusable #reusables #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #flatlay #expatsingapore #reusablealternatives #sgexpats #butfirstcoffee #zerowastetravel #zakka		#snackbag | #snackbaggie | #reusablebag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablefoodbag | #reusablesandwichbag | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeetogo | #coffeeonthego | #zerowastecoffee | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #flatlay | #expatsingapore | #reusablealternatives | #sgexpats | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastetravel | #zakka	@njingyi | @meiangiez	60	2	2020-02-25 12:59:34	False	False

B82aVAGn-Ib	*Stojo owners– can you help me out?*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Hi guys, I’m posting this from Tokyo. I didn’t want to make the trip so soon after returning from the last (it was about a month) but my friend moved to Tokyo end of last year and I wanted to visit, and I had expiring miles, and there was a redemption discount.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I used my @stojo today to get coffee to go for the first time in Tokyo. I googled for good coffee places and found @ntscoffeetokyo that’s near the hotel and went there specially for coffee – it was good coffee, They also carry @huskeecup reusable coffee cups so I’m happy about that because I haven’t seen many people use reusable coffee cups in Tokyo.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. What I’m not so happy about is that when I’m done with my coffee, I’d like to collapse it and chuck it in my bag but imy Stojo leaks – it seems to leak only with coffee (seldom water when I test) and only a little but a little is enough. Thankfully I have my strap so I don’t lose it when I’m out and can generally have my hands free for my subway card and phone. **What about you guys, Stojo owners? Do you have similar leaky issues with your cup? Or is it just me and how do you do it? Please let me know!!! 🙏**. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Thanks a bunch for your help! 🥰. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #coffeecupholder #coffeetogo #stojo #tinkerboxinthewild #zerowastetravelhack #singaporeexpats #sgexpats #expatsg #expatsingapore #singaporeexpatwives		#bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #coffeecupholder | #coffeetogo | #stojo | #tinkerboxinthewild | #zerowastetravelhack | #singaporeexpats | #sgexpats | #expatsg | #expatsingapore | #singaporeexpatwives	@stojo | @ntscoffeetokyo | @huskeecup	74	23	2020-02-22 09:08:56	False	False
B8yZy94nbxs	*Parts of a reusable pad and what they look like*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Over the last week or so, I realised that I’ve always shown you the pretty side of my pads and pantyliners – that’s the *backing* or *back* side that comes into contact with your underwear. I’ve also been asked if there are sticky dots on the backing; in my design there aren’t. This is because I don’t use synthetic fabric, which has a component of plastic in them and and tends to be slippery. My pads and liners generally stay in place as long as your undies are well-fitting and snug.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Next is the pad *topper* – the side that comes into contact with your skin. Different cloth pad makers use different materials; mine is soft unbleached cotton. There are many grades of cotton and the one I’ve selected is really soft and smooth on the skin. Being unbleached, it’s also less treated (all cloth has to be treated during manufacturing but unbleached would have skipped bleaching and the subsequent dyeing/printing of the pattern), and so is kinder to your skin, especially where your skin is thinner and more delicate (think the opposite of the skin on your feet).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. And we have the *core* inside that you don’t see, that absorbs your flow. I use various weights and types of cotton as natural fabrics are breathable, which makes wearing it more comfortable (less heat and moisture buildup) and healthy (less bacterial build up).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. No hidden plastic layer. No synthetic fabric! 🤗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I hope you found seeing the other side of pads and pantyliners useful! 🤗💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #periods #reusableperiodproducts #clothpads #rumps #reusablepads #reusablepantyliners #reusablemenstrualproducts #unbleachedcotton #100percentcotton #saynotodisposable #saynotosingleuse #plasticfreeperiod #unbleachedcotton #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowaste #zerowasteinspo #flatlay #shopeco #ecoalternatives #reusable #reusables #reusablealternatives #singleusealternatives #singaporeexpats #sgexpats #expatsg #expatsingapore #singaporeexpatwives #bekindtoplanetearth		#periods | #reusableperiodproducts | #clothpads | #rumps | #reusablepads | #reusablepantyliners | #reusablemenstrualproducts | #unbleachedcotton | #100percentcotton | #saynotodisposable | #saynotosingleuse | #plasticfreeperiod | #unbleachedcotton | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowaste | #zerowasteinspo | #flatlay | #shopeco | #ecoalternatives | #reusable | #reusables | #reusablealternatives | #singleusealternatives | #singaporeexpats | #sgexpats | #expatsg | #expatsingapore | #singaporeexpatwives | #bekindtoplanetearth		46	0	2020-02-20 19:47:20	False	False

B8qzY9InL9-	*Keeping bread fresh for longer*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My household is a two-hooman 👫-one-dog 🐶 one while we love freshly baked bread, we can only finish about half a loaf of sour dough every 2-3 days (this is partly because I don’t eat much for breakfast). I usually cut a loaf in halves, pop one half into a bread bag, wrap it up snugly, and into the freezer it goes! It’s worked really well for me (and definitely better than when I used to put my bread in a plastic container) because – I think – any water vapour from the bread is not trapped in a container, causing freezer burn, where ice 🧊 forms on the bread. It’s also easy to go from bakery to freezer and I don’t need to bother keep using the single-use paper or plastic bags that they hand out. And freezing bread is my fave way of making sure I don’t waste it.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My friend Joy made this loaf of sourdough for me. Thank you @joylai 😋😋😋 we had it with dinner tonight as an accompaniment to a simple stew, to look up the gravy.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. This bag is heading over to @chewy.sourdough 💛💛💛 I love sourdough! They’re best straight from the oven but if you do freeze, I reheat them in the oven and it’s the next best thing!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #foodbag #breadbag #baguettebag #zerowaste #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastesnacking #zerowasteonthego #reusable #reusables #reducewaste #consciouschoices #shoplocal #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplatic #saynotodisposables #flatlay #zerowasteinspo #zerowastetravel #zerowastetravelhack #singaporeexpats #sgexpats #expatsg #expatsingapore #singaporeexpatwives #sgmom		#foodbag | #breadbag | #baguettebag | #zerowaste | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastesnacking | #zerowasteonthego | #reusable | #reusables | #reducewaste | #consciouschoices | #shoplocal | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplatic | #saynotodisposables | #flatlay | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastetravel | #zerowastetravelhack | #singaporeexpats | #sgexpats | #expatsg | #expatsingapore | #singaporeexpatwives | #sgmom	@joylai | @chewy.sourdough	55	6	2020-02-17 20:57:03	False	False

B8n6Db6HD1T	*Sunday pre-dinner snack, anyone?*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. It’s not quite dinner time for me yet; cooking generally begins only after the sun has dry because the sun streams into the kitchen starting round 4 and I just can’t.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My stomach is asking for a snack and I wish I had some Old Chang Kee curry puff. A Krispy Kreme donut 🍩 would be nice too but all I have are donut plushies!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. This is my take on a Studio Ghibli inspired snack baggie! When @meiangiez said she liked Studio Ghibli, I thought of this print immediately; and this was her choice too! This print also reminded both of us of the Nintendo raving rabbits! Argh how cute!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I personally pick each fabric that is in my collection and I buy small quantities – typically 1 to 3 yards; sometimes when I’be used up my fabric, I can’t get more of the same so if you spot a fabric that you like, DM me about it quick!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Hope you’ve all had lovely weekends and are enjoying what’s left of the Sunday.

B8fciycHgZU	*Pretty things that bring a smile*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I spend a lot of time in my kitchen, it is really the heart of my home.

My kitchen is a mix of Ikea staples (my everyday dinner plates are white 90-cent plates that I bought more than 15 years ago when I was still living with my parents), Daiso impulse buys (I very soon realised that if I bought individual pieces from Daiso, it would still be a big chunk of change), investment pieces (I love enamelled cast iron cookware), and mismatched vintage in the form of teacups and saucers that I pick up on travels.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. If I make tea in a teapot, I love drinking it out of little pretty teacups; it’s a me-moment of stillness. Be prepared for the inevitable kitchen spills and quick clean up with some unpaper towels in pretty prints that also bring smiles (because, as I think we can all agree, kitchen clean up isn’t necessarily on our priority list of things to do).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These unpaper towels are heading to @angsonagreenpasture along with a snack baggie (swipe 👈) and some mini bowl covers (unpictured, but will photograph soon). I hope they bring smiles to you and your family 💛😍🥰😊️🙃. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #unpapertowel #unpapertowels #clothwipes #reusablecloth #reusablewipes #reusablecloths #reusables #reusable #cloth #cloths #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo #zerowastehacks . #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reducingwaste #flaylay #singaporeexpats #sgexpats #expatsg #expatsingapore #singaporeexpatwives #sgmom		#unpapertowel | #unpapertowels | #clothwipes | #reusablecloth | #reusablewipes | #reusablecloths | #reusables | #reusable | #cloth | #cloths | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastehacks | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reducingwaste | #flaylay | #singaporeexpats | #sgexpats | #expatsg | #expatsingapore | #singaporeexpatwives | #sgmom	@angsonagreenpasture	70	8	2020-02-13 11:05:46	False	False
B8Yk7RPHZDn	*These work with more than just Stojos and Keepcups!*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Have a reusable coffee cup that isn’t a #stojo or a #keepcup? You’ll be happy to know that my coffee cup straps work with other – coffee cups, Sol Cups, and most other reusable coffee cups that have a band around them! Just tell me what cup you have and if I need measurements, I’ll get them from you.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. @meiangiez ordered this sushi print (pause: how cute is this print? I’ve been after a sushi print for the longest time!) strap for her collapsible cup and she kindly left her cup overnight with me so that I could take measurements and tailor the buttons on the strap for her. This seems to be quite a popular cup so if you guys have one, feel free to buzz me for a strap.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I personally prefer a simple over the more common sleeves as it‘s neater, without excess fabric that a one-size-fits-most-sleeve inevitably ends up with. I’m also a perfectionist with a love for proportions so my Keepcup lengths are different from the Stojos. A good strap length should be one that allows you to slip the strap over your hand onto your wrist in case you need your hands to confirm directions on Google Maps 🗺 or pay for that curry puff 🥟 that’s going onto your reusable snack bag! Too many times I’ve placed my cup down only to walk away, leaving it on a shelf in a shop and needing to search 10 minutes to find it! (Once I left my Keepcup at a shop; when I got home, realised, and called the, they said they thrown it away 😭.). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteshop #consciouschoices #climatechangesolutions #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #makermovement #singaporeexpats #sgexpats #expatsg #expatsingapore #singaporeexpatwives #sgmom		#stojo | #keepcup | #bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteshop | #consciouschoices | #climatechangesolutions | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #makermovement | #singaporeexpats | #sgexpats | #expatsg | #expatsingapore | #singaporeexpatwives | #sgmom	@meiangiez	40	2	2020-02-10 19:04:20	False	False
B8SwCaZnhkM	*What can you put in one of these snack baggies?*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Each bag is ~ 17x17 cm. It’s sized to fit a nice sized sandwich 🥪 (any bigger, the sandwich will fall apart inside 😂) and so much more.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. 1-2 donuts 🍩 (I think two Krispy Kreme will fit), a pain au chocolat or croissant (or up to 3 minis that @Tiongbahrubakery does), 2 bagels 🥯 or 1 bagelwich from @twomenbagelhouse, 2 portions of cut fruit (of typical sizes that you get at the fruit seller after lunch, 200g of Famous Amos cookies, 2 curry puffs from @oldchangkeesingapore, 1-2 buns from local bakeries – to name a few.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My snack baggies have a certified food-safe lining that is waterproof and greaseproof so any residue from the food stays inside and won’t smear onto other things inside your bag. It weighs an average of just 26 grams so adds hardly any weight to a bag that might already contain your water bottle and reusable coffee cup.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. This llama 🦙 print fabric is brand new and this snack baggie is the first thing I’ve made with it 🤗 and to heading to it’s been home with @glittersheeps soon.

B8LfPa0H2Mr	*Roibos tea for my cold and a few minutes  to drool over my new fabrics*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Being a one-woman business, I handle everything from start to end – planning, designing, purchasing, production, marketing, delivery, and community engagement (to name a few of the more typical of departments in a company). Work *is* personal life and there’s no distinction. I’m currently down with a cold and still trying to cut and sew, but thought I’d drink some vanilla roibos tea (my dad has been waxing lyrical about its benefits) and share a recent completed order and some new fabrics 🤗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I managed to sneak in some incidental fabric shopping time on Monday while running errands. The thing about fabric shopping is that I never know if I will end up with any; sometimes I go home empty handed. On Monday, I picked up the navy blue polka dots (bottom right swathe which is different from the sewn cup strap that had gone to its new home) and the avocados. The next four were purchased just before CNY, and the sushi is from my recent trip to the US. The navy blue polka has been a perennial favourite and I’ve been looking for a new one as mine’s running out. I was really chuffed to find this one – sometimes it’s really difficult to find a simple print just the way you want it 🤗😂😍. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The avocado poll was a little divided – check stories for the results – but in the end I just had to get it because I don’t think I’ll find another avo print easily and more importantly **GUACAMOLE** 😍😍😍 What do you think If my new fabrics? Let me know if you have a fave.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #keepcup #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteshop #igsg #consciouschoices #climatechangesolutions #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #makermovement #coffeecupholder #singaporeexpats #coffeetogo #keepcup		#bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #keepcup | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteshop | #igsg | #consciouschoices | #climatechangesolutions | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #makermovement | #coffeecupholder | #singaporeexpats | #coffeetogo | #keepcup		60	7	2020-02-05 17:04:32	False	False
B8GV0wKHuGZ	*Keeping healthy and hygienic habits is more important than ever*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I keep an unpaper towel near the sink to wipe up any water from using the tap that inevitably splashes on the counter, condensation from cold things, accidental spills (thankfully if anything, my spills are just water and not anything sugary as I don’t have sweet drinks at home), etc. I wipe as I go and do a thorough clean once a week.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My counter top is kept dry so my unpaper towels usually are only slightly damp when I use them; I just lay it across my faucet to dry in-between uses. If it gets thoroughly wet (for example if I have to put in effort to wring the water out), that’s my cue to hang it outside where there’s better ventilation and moving air, then transfer to the dirty laundry pile once it’s dry, and take out a new unpaper towel. I hardly wash anything by hand because I don’t think I (personally) can agitate it as well as a washing machine.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I find that if i keep my cloths dry in between uses, I keep mildew formation at bay. My mother operates on a wet towel protocol and I really dislike touching wet cloths (bacteria multiplies faster in warm, damp environments and transfers most via liquids).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. With this 2019 Novel Coronavirus, wash you’re hands often, wipe down your screens regularly (I put a tiny drop of hand soap on the screen or dollop some suds from washing my hands on the screen and then wipe down), and change out your towels and wipes often. And on the body front, fruit and veg for fresh vitamins and water to hydrate.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #unpapertowel #unpapertowels #clothwipes #reusablecloth #reusablewipes #reusablecloths #reusables #reusable #cloth #cloths #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo #zerowastehacks . #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reducingwaste #flaylay #singaporeexpats #sgexpats #expatsg #expatsingapore #singaporeexpatwives #sgmom		#unpapertowel | #unpapertowels | #clothwipes | #reusablecloth | #reusablewipes | #reusablecloths | #reusables | #reusable | #cloth | #cloths | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastehacks | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reducingwaste | #flaylay | #singaporeexpats | #sgexpats | #expatsg | #expatsingapore | #singaporeexpatwives | #sgmom		55	2	2020-02-03 17:06:02	False	False

B78cuKknR-W	*I made some cloth napkins for our mealtimes!*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I used to buy paper napkins and used one at every meal. It was easy, it was cheap and I didn’t give a second thought to them. But I was buying (and using) too much paper napkins so about half a year ago, I decided not to restock and allow my single-use napkins to run out.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. For the most part, I don’t miss using a napkin but when we have company over for dinner, not having napkins is a little awkward.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My aunt bought some fat quarters for me in Japan (pictured: the florals and the Asanoha) and I had a random scrap of khaki linen (bottom of the pile) that I hadn’t even bothered to hem, so today was cloth napkin making day! Not only do I have a lovely set of reusable napkins, I got better acquainted with my serger and found a stitch that made for a more decorative finish to the napkins.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So what do you think of these cloth napkins? Do you like them? Would you get a set to use at home? I think they make mealtimes (even quick takeout lunches from downstairs) more fun and are nicer to use than disposable. Let me know if you would like a set yourself 💛🤗😘. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #dinnernapkins #reusablenapkins #linennapkins #clothnapkins #napkins #napkin #mealtimes #ecofriendly #zerowaste #zerowastiving #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastelife #zerowastemovement #greenliving #sustainableliving #zerowastesg #zerowastehacks #zerowastemovement #zerowasteinspo #reusable #reusables #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposable #singaporeexpats #sgexpats #expatsg #expatsingapore #singaporeexpatwives #sgmom #flatlay		#dinnernapkins | #reusablenapkins | #linennapkins | #clothnapkins | #napkins | #napkin | #mealtimes | #ecofriendly | #zerowaste | #zerowastiving | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastelife | #zerowastemovement | #greenliving | #sustainableliving | #zerowastesg | #zerowastehacks | #zerowastemovement | #zerowasteinspo | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposable | #singaporeexpats | #sgexpats | #expatsg | #expatsingapore | #singaporeexpatwives | #sgmom | #flatlay		68	6	2020-01-30 20:53:54	False	False

B7z_o3onCvp	*Bread and more*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The sewing has begun! 🤗🤗🤗 It’s taken me a couple more days to start on orders than I planned for as I’d not taken into account the post-holiday flat cleaning and associated laundry but I’ve started! Thank you for your patience with your pre-orders. I will be reaching out to you guys about delivery very soon!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. First off the sewing machine (pretty late last night) was this bread bag for @thelittlefreckles and how cute is this bag?! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I call it the *bread bag* because I use mine primarily for bread from bakeries (or my aunt @cakehandsbutterfingers). My preferred is fresh sourdough and sometimes we get challah, which makes great French toast. But this drawstring bag is so versatile you can use used it for a variety of foods – fruit, vegetables, individually sized buns! It folds flat and barely adds weight to your bag so it’s really convenient to take with you for unplanned bakery purchases.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My favourite bakeries? @bakerybrera and @simplybread for their croissants and pain au chocolat, @tiongbahrubakery for their kouign-amman, and @bakerycuisinesg’s Levure Naturelle for their baguette.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Offices reopen tomorrow! Will you be buying breakfast? If you do, remember to BYO and ditch the single use plastic bags 💛🤗💪. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #foodbag #breadbag #baguettebag #zerowaste #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastesnacking #zerowasteonthego #reusable #reusables #reducewaste #consciouschoices #shoplocal #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplatic #saynotodisposables #flatlay #zerowasteinspo #zerowastetravel #zerowastetravelhack #singaporeexpats #sgexpats #expatsg #expatsingapore #singaporeexpatwives #sgmom		#foodbag | #breadbag | #baguettebag | #zerowaste | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastesnacking | #zerowasteonthego | #reusable | #reusables | #reducewaste | #consciouschoices | #shoplocal | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplatic | #saynotodisposables | #flatlay | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastetravel | #zerowastetravelhack | #singaporeexpats | #sgexpats | #expatsg | #expatsingapore | #singaporeexpatwives | #sgmom	@thelittlefreckles | @cakehandsbutterfingers | @bakerybrera | @simplybread | @tiongbahrubakery | @bakerycuisinesg	43	2	2020-01-27 14:05:51	False	False

B7pxg-cHP7e	*Studio makeover and tidy up*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Just before I left in December, I re-did the layout of my studio. I say studio like it’s an actual studio but it’s a space carved out at home where creative magic happens, that sometimes spills over to the rest of the house 😂😂😂 It got really messy and it was time to do something about it.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I woke up at 5 a.m. this morning – jetlag urgh 😖 – and did more laundry 🧺 , put away things from my trip 🧳 , and continued clearing the studio. I had so many remnant fabric pieces haphazardly stashed in piles, not organised in any way and cluttering up my desk, cutting area and sewing space; it needed a tidy up!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So this morning, I sewed to get my remnant fabric under control and here are some completed facial cotton pads That replace disposable cotton pads or cotton wool. The rubber duckies 🐣 print was much loved and I only have scraps left that I’m pleased to be able to salvage and turn into reusable facial cotton pads.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Simply use with your make up remover or toner. Another fun zero waste replacement that’s really easy to implement!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The Studio’s almost ready now! I’m so excited. A little admin work tonight, and tomorrow I start on your orders! More pics to come!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowastejourney #zerowastebathroom #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastehacks #zerowastealternatives #zerowastetravel #facialrounds #cottonfacepads #reusables #saynotosingleuse #stylemepretty #makermovement #flatlay #eco #zerowasteinspo #zakka #cordtidy #shopsg #shoplocal #sgmaker #singaporeexpats #sgexpats #expatsg #expatsingapore #singaporeexpatwives		#zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastebathroom | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastehacks | #zerowastealternatives | #zerowastetravel | #facialrounds | #cottonfacepads | #reusables | #saynotosingleuse | #stylemepretty | #makermovement | #flatlay | #eco | #zerowasteinspo | #zakka | #cordtidy | #shopsg | #shoplocal | #sgmaker | #singaporeexpats | #sgexpats | #expatsg | #expatsingapore | #singaporeexpatwives		61	0	2020-01-23 14:50:02	False	False

B7NGK7wns7Y	*System change, not climate change 🙏💔🌏*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So I was in Charleston walking around, happy that I was using my reusable cup, proudly carrying it from my coffee cup! People commented on the cup and strap, and noticed  we used our own stainless steel containers and bamboo cutlery at breakfast. Don’t get me wrong , it’s great and I will continue using reusables wherever I can. But it’s not enough.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Today I went to on an old cotton plantation tour; a plantation that flourished on the backs of enslaved people. People were exploited for the production of xxx (name your crop). And our guide today said – I paraphrase, “Look at the clothes your wearing, think about how you got here, even your phones... do you think that anything could be free from the exploitation or some resource?”. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. That was hard. I mean... unless I live completely off the grid, farm permaculture... How do I leave a carbon neutral footprint? I’ve always been fascinated by what I know now is macro economics; I wish I had done more studies in this field.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. @gretathunberg said we need system change, and I wish I had a brain big enough to see an answer. But for now I’ll try. I’ll try to minimise my single-use, I’ll try to not impulse buy things, I’ll try to help wherever I can (workshop soon for Australia’s affected animals, please support!), and I’ll try to be more grateful for all the privileges I’ve been afforded 💛 Thank you for being on this journey with me.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Btw, the 2nd pic shows how I store my cup and strap 🤗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #keepcup #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteshop #consciouschoices #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #coffeecupholder #eco #coffeetogo @stojo #stojo #tinkerboxinthewild #systemchangenotclimatechange  #systemchange		#bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #keepcup | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteshop | #consciouschoices | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #coffeecupholder | #eco | #coffeetogo | #stojo | #tinkerboxinthewild | #systemchangenotclimatechange | #systemchange	@gretathunberg | @stojo	54	5	2020-01-12 11:32:33	False	False
B7FLn-On13K	*Choosing sustainability is a privilege*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I know I’m privileged – as I type this, I’m on a clean bed in Wilmington, North Carolina on vacation to visit family and friends; I’ve a pretty nice smart phone that lets me take and edit great pictures, WiFi and data, and headspace to plan what I can do (financially and in service) to help with the Australian bushfire crisis. This is privilege.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Privilege means having the resources to invest in something upfront for the future; we don’t even have to think about it, it’s given.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I was first acquainted with the idea of privilege when I read a case study about how people buy laundry detergent in sachets, which work out to be waaaay more expensive than buying a box or bottle. The big manufacturers make more money per unit from those little sachets than they do a big bottle 😡😤. People with limited income need this and can’t afford to go without for the length of time needed to save up it. I know another family who (back then) had rented their TV at £50/month for years; I couldn’t understand why they didn’t just buy a TV for £250 but I guess present need was prioritised.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Having a reusable coffee cup is a privilege; that my home has four is privilege. You reading this is privilege. I’m trying not to take what I have for granted even though there will always be others who have more. If hadn’t been born into a life with some privilege, I wouldn’t be in a position to make a difference.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Choose wisely. Reuse as much as you can. Be bold. Be kind. Help wherever possible 🥰. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #keepcup #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteshop #igsg #consciouschoices #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #coffeecupholder #eco #coffeetogo @stojo #stojo @keepcup #systemchangenotclimatechange #shopeco		#bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #keepcup | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteshop | #igsg | #consciouschoices | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #coffeecupholder | #eco | #coffeetogo | #stojo | #systemchangenotclimatechange | #shopeco	@stojo | @keepcup	67	4	2020-01-09 09:46:17	False	False

B6zvsfAH7Xz	☆ New year, new cup ☆  Ang Ang for good luck! . Talking about using reusables, last year, we started a recycling bin in our house, and we've continue to sustain the habit of putting the recyclable materials back into the big blue bin at the void deck. Little Foot checks in whenever she wants to toss something, so that it goes into the right bin. I thank her preschool teachers for 2 years of #savetheearth projects and discussions on being earth-friendly. . 2020, we will continue to tweak our lifestyle to be more environmentally friendly - reuse, reduce, recycle, a little footprint at a time. . #alittlefootprint #firstdayof2020 #startingtheyearright #reusereducerecycle #reusables #stojo #starbucks #lymia #adashofred #sunnies #staypositive #singapore		#savetheearth | #alittlefootprint | #firstdayof2020 | #startingtheyearright | #reusereducerecycle | #reusables | #stojo | #starbucks | #lymia | #adashofred | #sunnies | #staypositive | #singapore		24	9	2020-01-02 15:15:08	False	False
B6zk5eTHbVs	*Volcano mocha – mocha with chilli 🌶 – on a cold winter’s day*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Far from having done any statistically significant research, the coffee scene in Philly brings some interesting flavour profiles that I haven’t seen (much of or at all) in other cities. My favourites are raspberry mocha and chilli 🌶 mocha 👌👍😋. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. We went to the Italian Market yesterday and a must-visit whenever I’m there is @fantes9thstreet, a cook shop that sells baking and cooking periphernalia. I spent 30 seconds in the coffee section before realising they had a little coffee shop section with a barista and proper coffee 🤗 It was freezing so I got the Volcano – a mocha with chilli 🌶. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I got my @stojo out and struck up a conversation with the barista about why I bring my own. I haven’t seen many (or any) reusable coffee cups in NYC or Philly; everyone carries single use paper cups. It’s slightly disheartening but I chug on. Maybe people aren’t aware yet and putting coffee in my reusable coffee cup is moving the needle of awareness along that little bit. I’ve also started conversations with friends and family through buying food from the market in my food container, snacks (in my snack baggie), and washing my bamboo cutlery after use (and them bring curious about my cutlery pouch).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m headed to Baltimore tomorrow enroute to Washington DC and I’d love a raspberry mocha from @luckygoatphilly; I couldn’t leave Philly without one and I’m thinking about getting two 8oz coffees in my 16oz cup!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B6o_RE7BSYJ	[Low waste bathroom: Part 1] .. . The bathroom was the first place we made numerous swaps for sustainable alternatives when we started our journey towards creating less waste in our home. It was easier and less stressful. .. . We also designed the bathroom to make it easier for our kids to independently reach their shower essentials including the position of the shower head. .. . From left to right are: a soap bag from @thesustainabilityproject_ to store bits of soap and use it every week to exfoliate; feminine wash (only thing in plastic but I don’t mind! I’m going to use the same bottle for refills soon!); refillable shampoo and conditioner from @unpackt.sg ; my absolute favourite shampoo and conditioner bar from @solidskincareco (I’ve tried about 6-7 brands but this is the best in my opinion! More on that in a separate post); soap bars from @soapammasoaps (I also have other palm-oil free ones from @scoopwholefoods_sg) and. .. . The best part about using soap bars vs their liquid counterparts is that they last for longer, are package free (mostly!) and don’t have much carbon emissions when being shipped to the store when compared to large bottles of liquid solutions. .. . A good tip to keeping your soap bars from dying out soon is to use soap dishes with good drainage and ensuring they’re dry after use.			@thesustainabilityproject_ | @unpackt.sg | @solidskincareco | @soapammasoaps | @scoopwholefoods_sg	63	7	2019-12-29 10:59:34	False	False
B6idDmGnZou	*Coffee so far*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Tonight’s our last night in the city 🗽and before we head to stay with family for the next week or so. I haven’t bought coffee to go in my reusable coffee cup so far, because a pit stop in a warm coffee ☕️ shop is a welcome respite from the cold (it’s about 6°C here now) and independent coffee shops seem to want to serve coffee in reusables as opposed to the paper cups of the big chains like @Starbucks or @dunkin donuts. Where we have been using our coffee cups is *in the hotel* 😲 as the Sheraton @fourpoints only provides disposable cups.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m really glad I added dish soap and a scrubbie to my packing list so I can keep my water bottle and coffee cup clean! For those of your who were interested in testing out my scrubbie, I haven’t forgotten! I ran out of time before departure to make them but I will when I’m back and I will send them to you.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These two straps were my last order to go out before I left and they’re orders for @vanthewee. I’m so glad you got them before/on Christmas 🎄 Day!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B6XmgA7HsyU	*Limited edition coffee cup straps and snack baggies in modern, minimal prints, designed by The Patternholic*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. How beautiful are these designs 😍😍😍? I am so pleased to partner up with @thepatternholic for snack baggies and coffee cup straps, made from her illustrations that she printed on fabric. (Swipe to see more of her designs and click through to her grid 👆) for more lovely prints 💛💛💛.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Many of you have asked me about her prints and if you could get a snack baggie or coffee cup strap in her prints; the short answer is – yes, in limited quantities. Some of you have indicated interest in my stories poll too. I will be collating these replies and tag you in a post when they are available for. Items made in these prints will be a little more expensive that usual; this is because it’s a small (non-commercial) print run and not available at any fabric market. I’m away from tomorrow (Monday) evening so any orders will be subject to availability and delivery will commence in February.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Each snack baggie is ~17x17 cm with a certified food safe inner lining that’s waterproof and grease proof. Coffee cup straps can be customised (e.g., to fit the @Stojo @Keepcup), just let me know.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. If you’ve read thus far and haven’t clicked over, here’s her IG again 🤗 – @thepatternholic. Now most importantly, which print is your favourite? Leave a comment below!!🙏. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbaggie #reusablebag #reusablesnackbag #reusablefoodbag #reusablesandwichbag #reusablecoffeecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeetogo #coffeeonthego #zerowastecoffee #reusablepouch #reusable #reusables #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #flatlay #expatsingapore #reusablealternatives #singaporeexpatwives #sgexpats #butfirstcoffee		#snackbag | #snackbaggie | #reusablebag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablefoodbag | #reusablesandwichbag | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeetogo | #coffeeonthego | #zerowastecoffee | #reusablepouch | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #flatlay | #expatsingapore | #reusablealternatives | #singaporeexpatwives | #sgexpats | #butfirstcoffee	@thepatternholic | @Stojo | @Keepcup | @thepatternholic	94	14	2019-12-22 16:56:03	False	False
B6QOlAvHRBH	*A little break, soon*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m almost done with orders for the year – in time for Christmas – and I’m wrapping up to go on a little break. I’ll be back end Jan and resuming deliveries in Feb, but I’ll be answering questions on IG DM, taking pre-orders in the meantime, and sharing my own zero waste journey and  the interesting things that pop up along the way!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Thank you for having me part of your Christmas. I personally hand make everything myself and handmade takes time so thank you all for having the patience to wait for your orders to be made! Some of you have already pre-booked me for orders next year and I can’t wait to organise my 2020 line up 💛💛💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Here’s a furoshiki wrapping cloth making its way to @pretinpink, along with a snack baggie and a Stojo reusable coffee cup strap! I love these wraps because they’re so versatile; they fold up flat and you can knot them to accommodate a variety of shapes – wine bottles 🍾, lunchboxes, bread 🍞!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I still have sewing to do so my break hasn’t started. More snack baggies, coffee cup straps, pads, and a special last minute order for a customer who’s been very patiently waiting on standby! ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablebag #coffeecupstrap #furoshiki #wrap #furokishiwrap #furoshikicloth #clothwrap #reusable #reusables #lunchonthego #onthego #takeout #takeaway #byo #bringyourown #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #flatlay #expatsingapore #reusablealternatives #singaporeexpatwives #sgexpats		#reusablebag | #coffeecupstrap | #furoshiki | #wrap | #furokishiwrap | #furoshikicloth | #clothwrap | #reusable | #reusables | #lunchonthego | #onthego | #takeout | #takeaway | #byo | #bringyourown | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #flatlay | #expatsingapore | #reusablealternatives | #singaporeexpatwives | #sgexpats	@pretinpink	71	4	2019-12-19 20:12:20	False	False

B5FN6njFqCH	| kfc_sg | #chickencongee.. .. ❎ A BYO Half-Fail Day: So I've been wanting to have a hot and comforting KFC Chicken Porridge breakkie bowl for a while now. Finally summoned up enough courage to ask if I could #byo. Aunty paused, smiled and took my old, battered #reusable soup jar to the back-of-house. Returned a while later with this - all beautifully served and garnished, so happy!. .. While Aunty sweetly commented the insulated jar was a great size, I was to discover then she had gingerly transferred the contents from an already packed disposable bowl to mine. I was actually hoping she would fill it straight from the cooking pot all the while ..... .. A bitter-sweet day it is. Tho' I enjoyed the momentary spot of fast-food tummy-warming goodness; the joy was short-lived 😭. Will dine-in next time, and just ignore the poor ventilation and greasy fumes.... .. .. ❎ FAILED: on the disposable bowl. ✅ Only saved: the plastic cutlery and carrier bag.. . #byo #lunchbox #foodjar #byokit #bringyourownkit #bringyourown #ibringmyownsg #byosingapore #reusable #reusables #reusablecontainer #ecolife #ecofriendly #ecolifestyle #whatsinmybag #saynotosingleuseplastic #reduceplastic #plasticfree #nosingleuse #nodisposables #foodshare #realfood #devourpower #eatingfortheinsta #tastingtable #foodiesofinstagram. .		#chickencongee | #byo | #reusable | #byo | #lunchbox | #foodjar | #byokit | #bringyourownkit | #bringyourown | #ibringmyownsg | #byosingapore | #reusable | #reusables | #reusablecontainer | #ecolife | #ecofriendly | #ecolifestyle | #whatsinmybag | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #reduceplastic | #plasticfree | #nosingleuse | #nodisposables | #foodshare | #realfood | #devourpower | #eatingfortheinsta | #tastingtable | #foodiesofinstagram		41	4	2019-11-20 17:03:31	False	False

B549bb1nyN6	*Thank you! 😍😍😍*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. And just like that, we’re 15 sleeps to Christmas 🎄! This Christmas has probably been my busiest but probably one of my happiest because I’m doing something I believe in.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Thank you @ly_qi for allowing me (my snack baggies) to be a part of your Christmas. I’d love to know which one you’re keeping for yourself 🤗🤗🤗 and je you post it, please tag me @insidethetinkerbox and hashtag #tinkerboxinthewild 💛💛💛 Thank you for choosing reusable alternatives and  keeping more single-use plastics away from incineration and landfill.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Each snack baggie is ~ 17x17 cm and designed to fit a single portion for when you need a snack on the go! It is greaseproof and waterproof so you can safely enjoy a sandwich or burger for lunch or cut fruit after lunch!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m heading off on a little break from Christmas Eve but I’ll be sewing 🧵 up till then. I’m still accepting selected orders depending on what your order and the quantity. Please DM me to discuss!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. There are a few fresh fabrics in Yu Qi’s order that are firsts – the light blue fish and the forest green with thin white lines! I’ve gotten a few requests for fabric patterns that aren’t so cutesy so the green dots the bill. Which one do you like and which one would you like?

We don’t live in the vicinity but we’re there often for vet appointments – perhaps once every six weeks.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I really like Nylon Coffee for their coffee, for their friendliness and for their willingness to think of their impact on the environment.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Today, I picked up a sack of burlap sacks that their coffee comes in (I got 11 or 12 sacks). Thank you Nylon for allowing me to repurpose your coffee sacks and give them a second lease of life 💛💛💛.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I just made my mom her second dish scrubbie from it – she likes that they scrub cooked-on stuff off well, yet are nice and gentle on her pots and pans. If anyone wants to try a jute dish scrubbie *free* please leave a comment or send a message.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Because I was holding @nanalovesapples, I couldn’t go in to order. Their staff came out and very kindly took my order from outside! 👌 Top marks for friendliness and service! Thank you so much Nylon for making my day!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

There are so many more snacks that could go inside one of these snack baggies with the waterproof and grease proof liner. Many people pick up breakfast on the way to work and while Bread Talk havé implemented a multi-item bag with hands to combat the bun-in-a-bag-in-a-bag (in yet another bag).

It helps when the people behind the business are passionate about what they do and what they stand for. A reason why I would pay my dollar towards small businesses and supporting them.

B5Oxz-VnxxB	*Stojo straps*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve had a fair amount of orders for Stojo straps recently, probably as Christmas gifts. A pair of these rainbow ones are now with @whoiscat and will accompany her to the home of good coffee. (Cat, send me pics please!!!) So I’m stocking a few stojo straps with @eco_le_sg today (swipe 👈 for options). Please check with them if you’re going there specially for the straps, as quantities are limited!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These straps have gone through a few iterations and I’m very happy with them now. They’re shorter than my original to accommodate for the top heaviness and lower band placement of the Stojo. And since I now have my own Biggie, I know how important it is to secure the band as snugly as possible around the cup.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Since the Stojo is so popular, the straps would be a great Christmas pressie. I know some people don’t see the need for a carrier but *I do do personally!* I lost one Keepcup (I called shortly after but they threw it away 😫) and I’ve misplaced another several times while window shopping simply because I needed both hands!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Heading out today for brunch with friends followed by a pad making workshop at @eco_le_sg! Looking forward to see you guys! I think I might know some of you! 🤗🤗🤗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #keepcup #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteshop #igsg #consciouschoices #climatechangesolutions #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #makermovement #coffeecupholder #eco #coffeetogo @stojo #stojo		#bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #keepcup | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteshop | #igsg | #consciouschoices | #climatechangesolutions | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #makermovement | #coffeecupholder | #eco | #coffeetogo | #stojo	@whoiscat | @eco_le_sg | @eco_le_sg | @stojo	73	0	2019-11-24 10:10:21	False	False

B5Cbzw0nGti	*Plants in the ocean, the jungle, and the dessert*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The resurgence of plant popularity is quite nice, the idea of building an oasis in the city; it’s on trend. Plants are nice though – they positively affect mood and mental health, and (on however small a scale) take in carbon dioxide.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These pads are going to @elizabelsy and @tropism, and when I put them together for a picture, it wasn’t just about how lovely they looked together, but a story of ecosystems – the marine 🐳 ecosystem, the jungle 🌿ecosystem, and even the dessert 🌵 ecosystem. In a working ecosystem, there are cycles and renewal – a time to sow and a time to reap.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve only ever lived in an urban setting and I’m tremendously grateful to the opportunities I’ve had simply because I was born where I was. I don’t see urbanisation  though, as an ecosystem because I’m not putting back what I’m taking out. And that’s what I’ve been learning – we got where we did because we utilised resources; we exploited resources🏭. The haves gain more, and the have-nots suffer. This is the economics I didn’t understand in school.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Moving forward, I’m looking into how I can give back. I don’t know how yet. I think I want to plant trees, so I’m researching that. Have you done research or know if any programmes? If you do, please leave me a comment/DM. I’d love to know more.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablepads #reusables #clothpads #pads #rumps #reusablepantyliners #pantyliner #reusablemenstrualproducts #pad #ecofriendlypads #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowasteperiods #zerowasteperiod #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastejourney #reusable #consciouschoices #saynotosingleuse #flatlay #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #happyperiod #happyperiods #zerowasteinspo #mondayblues #marineconservation		#reusablepads | #reusables | #clothpads | #pads | #rumps | #reusablepantyliners | #pantyliner | #reusablemenstrualproducts | #pad | #ecofriendlypads | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowasteperiods | #zerowasteperiod | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastejourney | #reusable | #consciouschoices | #saynotosingleuse | #flatlay | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #happyperiod | #happyperiods | #zerowasteinspo | #mondayblues | #marineconservation	@elizabelsy | @tropism	54	4	2019-11-19 15:07:11	False	False

B44liQ_HdsI	*Taking care of your unpaper towels*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. If you 💛 dogs, check out @trexthedinopoodle 😍🐶 he’s *adoggable* 🤗🤗🤗.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. @macymeisi is a lovely repeat customer and when she comes over to pick stuff up, she stop by to say hi to @nanalovesapples. The conversations we have about dogs 😅 She decided to get more unpaper towel minis for herself and Rex!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Many of you love my dino prints and and Macy initially selected 2 of them for Rex. I suggested a third and she thought it was a great idea to differentiate hers from his. He gets 🦕 because .. Rex. T-Rex 🦖. How cute is that? In my opinion, another great example of fabric design that says something about the recipient.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Macy also brought up the issue of mould which I’ll address here. Because Singapore’s weather is so humid, try to hang your unpaper towels to dry in a well ventilated space. Moving air is preferable to direct sunlight in an area against a wall or closed window; if the air surrounding the item is saturated with water molecules, drying will be more laborious and mould may still develop. A washing machine‘s spin cycle will wring out more water than what you can get with your hands so that’s something to note as well.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Hope this helps (I’ve learnt from bad experience of hanging my bath towels in my bathroom which is incredibly humid)!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #unpapertowel #unpapertowels #clothwipes #reusablecloth #reusablewipes #unpapers #reusablecloths #reusables #reusable #cloth #cloths #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo #zerowastehacks #zerowastelifehacks #zerowastecloths. saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reducingwaste #zerowastegram #flaylay #montessori #childfriendly #preparedenvironment		#unpapertowel | #unpapertowels | #clothwipes | #reusablecloth | #reusablewipes | #unpapers | #reusablecloths | #reusables | #reusable | #cloth | #cloths | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastehacks | #zerowastelifehacks | #zerowastecloths | #saynotodisposables | #reducingwaste | #zerowastegram | #flaylay | #montessori | #childfriendly | #preparedenvironment	@trexthedinopoodle | @macymeisi | @nanalovesapples	73	6	2019-11-15 19:19:47	False	False
B41vCbeHOEM	*How do i get my friends to stop with the single-use already?*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. @pegs_tabao’s colleague used to laugh at her reusable items – coffee cups, straws, containers – but was influenced positively, and now has his own #stojo, and even uses it for more than just drinks!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So she decided to get some reusable coffee cup straps as Christmas gifts for her friends and family – for three @keepcup and two @stojo reusable coffee cups.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I was recently asked “How can you get other people who don’t care about single-use to stop single-use?” You can’t *make*them. But you can go about your day confident that even if it’s something as small as bringing your own coffee cup, every little helps. And each time they see it (and your enthusiasm), I’d like to think there’s a little change in their receptivity to BYO.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These straps have been sent out into the world to @macymeisi and @pegs_tabao 🤗 When I started taking pics this morning, everything looked so nicely monotone (there is colour in the blue with orange flowers, and in the gold of the Asanoha but the desaturated tones are lovely). Thank you for your support, and I hope the recipients love them as much as I do! 💛💛💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #keepcup #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteshop #igsg #consciouschoices #climatechangesolutions #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #makermovement #coffeecupholder #eco #coffeetogo		#stojo | #bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #keepcup | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteshop | #igsg | #consciouschoices | #climatechangesolutions | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #makermovement | #coffeecupholder | #eco | #coffeetogo	@pegs_tabao | @keepcup | @stojo | @macymeisi | @pegs_tabao	64	7	2019-11-14 16:45:05	False	False

B4wQzg0H3ng	*Watermelon in a snack baggie?*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve been watching documentaries on Netflix while sewing and today’s theme is food – the science of, what’s good for you, the benefits of a plant-based diet. I wanted something sweet and cold and was thinking of ice cream 🍨 but decided on watermelon 🍉 instead. After all, it was cut and ready to go.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Eating fruit is a great idea! It is a whole food, unprocessed and unadulterated (ice cream is totally a processed food 😂). My cousin bought a whole watermelon for $7, cut it up herself and split it among 3 households!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Whether you bring your own from home or get some from the fruit seller when you’re out, have you thought of using a snack baggie instead of those single use plastic bags that will probably never get a second use? My snack baggies are a pretty cotton exterior with a certified food safe lining that’s greaseproof and waterproof. It’s not meant for liquids like soup, as there are seams in the pouch, but a little liquid from fruit (yes, even watermelon) will be sufficiently contained. I avoid sharp objects like skewers that might puncture the lining so one of your reusables (like my bamboo fork from @bamboostrawgirl) will be perfect. Where you’re done, just flip the pouch inside out and wash the lining that’s come into contact with the food with a little dish soap, and dry open. It usually dries in under an hour.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I have pads of lovely prints and these are the ones that are heading to @atikahilyani (swipe 👈) today! 💛💛💛 I hope they serve you well!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbags #reusablesandwichbags #foodbag #reusablesnackbag #reusablesnackbags #sandwichbags  #zerowaste #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastesnacking #zerowasteonthego #reusable #reusables #reducewaste #consciouschoices #consciousconsumer #shoplocal #artisan #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #saynotodisposaes #watermelon #eatclean #healthychoices #fruit		#snackbag | #snackbags | #reusablesandwichbags | #foodbag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablesnackbags | #sandwichbags | #zerowaste | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastesnacking | #zerowasteonthego | #reusable | #reusables | #reducewaste | #consciouschoices | #consciousconsumer | #shoplocal | #artisan | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #saynotodisposaes | #watermelon | #eatclean | #healthychoices | #fruit	@bamboostrawgirl | @atikahilyani	68	8	2019-11-12 13:44:42	False	False

B4rQXHwHU6m	*The navy Asanoha, now in a glittery ✨ gold edition*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. You guys really liked the navy Asanoha – I’d initially purchased a scrap half yard to test and it has been one of my most popular fabrics. I purchased a further 3 yards and it’s pretty much gone. I only have 1 yard of this gold on navy and it’s been cut and earmarked for snack baggies. The first of which has already gone to @aicreations so I have only 9 more!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I took my own snack baggie out on my walk with @nanalovesapples today and got a kouign-aman at Tiong Bahru Bakery. The Holland Village branch has a little takeout hole in the wall and they just popped it in (I used my snack baggie; this shot was for photography purposes only).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. This is another really easy entry for people considering reusables to replace small plastic bags at bakeries and Old Chang Kee. It hardly weighs anything and the lining dries in under an hour. If you’ve been wondering how to encourage a friend or family member to BYO, this is  great option, with added sparkle for Christmas!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. 45 sleeps till Christmas!

B4o7IbhHVJd	*This Christmas 🎄*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Christmas gift 🎁 exchanging is a fun thing to do with family and friends, but can so easily get out of hand in the name of fun. Years ago, I bought some cheap plastic sword with swirling glitter; what was the purpose of such a ludicrous, useless gift (and there were no children at the party)? Not my best moment.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. It’s always difficult balancing wants and needs but I hope that I’ll be able to get family and friends to re-evaluate their use of singe-use. I have in mind two kids in Washington DC who’ll love snack baggies (sized for sandwiches for school and snacks on road trips), and a bounty paper towel loving home in New York that will benefit from unpaper towels.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Sometimes it’s really difficult to understand the switch until you do. When you get a reusable item as a gift. It’s easier to just try it’s and then you wonder why you didn’t do it earlier!

B4l9hJAHDOH	*Enjoying food on the go!*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I am a total foodie! For me, so many things are important besides the taste of food. The texture different foods combined, how they come together in a meal, and their presentation (crappy single plastic use box – no joy).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I am also a big fan of leftovers and try not to waste food, so leftovers for lunch is always a good idea!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. All this comes together nicely in this collab with @seastainable.co – afurokishi wrap sized to work with their 1000ml collapsible food containers, yet versatile enough double or triple up as a placemat, napkin, or emergency carrier. When you’re done with lunch, simply collapse the bowl, tie the wrap around and pop into your bag!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The two prints – Salmon Pink and Ocean Blues 👈👈 – were specially selected in conjunction with their initiative to support marine conservation in Singapore and around Southeast Asia (head over to their website, link in *their* bio) for more info.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The wraps are available for purchase exclusively on their website and there’s a limited number so please only get what you need.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Happy Friyay! 🤗😍😊. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablebag #coffeecupstrap #baofok #baobu #wrappingcloth #furoshiki #wrap #furokishiwrap #furoshikicloth #clothwrap #reusable #reusables #lunchonthego #onthego #takeout #takeaway #byo #bringyourown #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #flatlay #takeyourseat		#reusablebag | #coffeecupstrap | #baofok | #baobu | #wrappingcloth | #furoshiki | #wrap | #furokishiwrap | #furoshikicloth | #clothwrap | #reusable | #reusables | #lunchonthego | #onthego | #takeout | #takeaway | #byo | #bringyourown | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #flatlay | #takeyourseat	@seastainable.co	75	2	2019-11-08 13:43:46	False	False

B4hFSoYHxbq	*When will we reach the critical mass tipping point on climate change where we’re not the minority anymore?*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. “System change not climate change,” that’s what @gretathunberg is call for. It’s not about the reusable straw or the reusable pad. And yet it is about the reusable straw and the reusable pad.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Individual effort seems small. It *is* small compared to what large corporations can do. But when many individuals start doing something differently, it become a collective voice, and the stronger that voice, the more governments and corporations will need to listen and change. (I’ve added a link to an article that explains the sigmoid curve of system change. It’s in the linktree in my bio.). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. We might be the minority but we’re most definitely not alone! 🐥🐥🐥🦢🐥. In the meantime, if you switched out disposable pads for reusables, you’d save 216 pads a year from being incinerated (toxic fumes) and ultimately going to landfill (space limitations, toxic substances leaching into the ground and water systems). How’s that for making a difference?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. This pad and liner are headed to @jinglebellyee soon and I’m excited.

B4Zf9_PnHWn	*Almond mylk in my coffee ☕️ today at The Conscious Festival. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve been thinking about switching from milk to mylk (Urban Dictionary: an alternatively spelled word used to describe plant derived 'milks”). It’s one of those things that doesn’t actually take a lot of effort but is easy to procrastinate about because routine behaviour doesn’t require much conscious thought and therefore saves the brain energy. But not thinking about things differently won’t get us out of the hole we’ve dug ourselves into.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Did a quick run to #TheConsciousFestival today to get single forks and knives from @bamboostrawgirl as I’m preparing for a trip away after Christmas (have spoons and chopsticks but no knives or forks!) and got my first almond @milklabco coffee and it was awesome!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve decided I now need to put some thought into my milk vs. mylk situation. It’s my next swap. What’s your next swap?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Pictured: coffee cup strap order for @aicreations for the @Stojo (also fits the @Keepcup) in the sloth print.

B4T7TUqnp1T	*Just one please*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So often, society tells us subtly that one (or enough) isn’t enough and we need more – to make it worthwhile, that more is good. The message comes through when people say “just” one for a seat in a restaurant (have you ever heart “just two”?), how loose sweet potatoes at @littlefarms costs $1 more per kilo than plastic prepacked, ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Too often, I’ve bought things in multi buy packs that have just gone to waste because I can’t finish them in time.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. This is my favourite egg tart – @taicheongsg. I have been guilty of buying multiple egg tarts and not eating them quickly enough that the crust gets damp, and the custard shrivels and oozes liquid – compare that with fresh out of the oven. I’ve saved many an egg tart by air-frying them but I’ve also thrown a few away – it’s throwing ~$2 away per egg tart and it’s food waste.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The other thing that bugs me about #TaiCheongsg is when I see the staff carefully box up 4 egg tarts in a well constructed box that hasn’t any other use, and customers who demand multiple plastic bags (that are shaped specially for the box and made from nice thick plastic but has little secondary use); my heart hurts.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I felt like an egg tart today and so I got one in my snack baggie; they would have put one egg tart in one paper (I think) bag otherwise.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I would like to see enough as being a good thing. Table for one. One (or enough) egg tart(s) for now 🤗👍👆. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbaggie #reusablebag #reusablesnackbag #reusablefoodbag #reusablesandwichbag #foodbag #sandwichbag #reusable #reusables #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastefood #zerowasteonthego #breadwithoutbags #byob #bringyourown #bringyourownbag #zerowastezakka #taicheongeggtarts #tinkerboxinthewild #friyay		#TaiCheongsg | #snackbag | #snackbaggie | #reusablebag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablefoodbag | #reusablesandwichbag | #foodbag | #sandwichbag | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastefood | #zerowasteonthego | #breadwithoutbags | #byob | #bringyourown | #bringyourownbag | #zerowastezakka | #taicheongeggtarts | #tinkerboxinthewild | #friyay	@littlefarms | @taicheongsg	49	4	2019-11-01 13:38:04	False	False
B4RNQFqHknf	*Finally, some time for tea 🍵 *. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Last week, my sewing machine crapped up. It sewed, but it didn’t sew well. It definitely didn’t sew well at a quality that I was happy with, a quality that you guys know to expect from me. It was a nightmare.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Thankfully, a friend had semi-permanently lent me her sewing machine and it was at my parents’ (so I can sew when I’m there for dinner). Also thankfully, I have a dad who’s always willing to go the extra mile and help – whether I forgot my keys or wallet or laptop – and he brought the machine over without hesitation.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. As a one-woman small business, I am so grateful for the help of family and friends. It truly takes a village. And even on @instagram, thank you for *your* community, love and support!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. While my own sewing machine isn’t up to scratch yet, the crisis is over and I’ve spent the last few days catching up on orders – thank you for your patience 😍😍😍.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I finished this lovely set of three liners and two 21.5 cm pads today for @tiffytif17 and brewed some hojicha 🍵 to celebrate a mini victory.

B4Lt9O1nNoj	*A little hack for storing unpaper towel minis*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I love the gardening section at Ikea. The plant pots are so pretty and the lightweight metal ones are so practical for things other than plants (because they’re so light). I repurpose plant pots for storing my cutlery upright, as an entryway catch-all by the front door.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. And I’ve just realised that the smallest size is perfect as a holder for unpaper towel minis! 😯🤗🥰. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These pink apple print minis will be making their way to @3mm.montessori very soon and I can’t wait to see them styled. It’s really easy to be tempted to reach for the throwaway alternative so what Jasmine does is to have both tissues and unpaper towel side by side so grabbing a reusable is just as easy.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The gold @ikeasingapore Daidai is my absolute favourite garden hack item. It’s a brushed bronzy-champagney gold plant pot that’s so versatile (the 9 cm is a great size for my @artezaofficial fabric markers, and the 19cm one holds @nanalovesapples’ harness and lead by the front door).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Right! I’ve finished my coffee and it’s time for Nana’s morning walk. Have a wonderful Tuesday! 🤗😍😊. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #unpapertowel #unpapertowels #clothwipes #reusablecloth #reusablewipes #unpapers #reusablecloths #reusables #reusable #cloth #cloths #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo #zerowastehacks #zerowastelifehacks #zerowastecloths. saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reducingwaste #zerowastegram #flaylay #preparedenvironment #montessoriathome #childsized		#unpapertowel | #unpapertowels | #clothwipes | #reusablecloth | #reusablewipes | #unpapers | #reusablecloths | #reusables | #reusable | #cloth | #cloths | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastehacks | #zerowastelifehacks | #zerowastecloths | #saynotodisposables | #reducingwaste | #zerowastegram | #flaylay | #preparedenvironment | #montessoriathome | #childsized	@3mm.montessori | @ikeasingapore | @artezaofficial | @nanalovesapples	40	2	2019-10-29 09:07:32	False	False

B4JkJUln3Yp	*Snack baggie FAQ*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Many of you guys in the community already know about snack baggies but for those who haven’t heard about it, here’s a little FAQ!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Q: Can I put greasy/hot food inside?. A: My snack baggies are lined with a certified food safe, greaseproof and waterproof liner. You can put foods with high water content (like fruit), or hot greasy foods (like a baked sweet potato) in it easily. It’s not meant for liquids so don’t use this with soup!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Q: How do I wash it? Is this machine washable?. A: Simply turn inside out and hand wash with a little dish soap, and air dry. Your snack baggie will be ready for use again in under an hour. Machine washable too, just put it in a washing bag and set your machine to a cold wash. Do not tumble dry. Do not use fabric softener as this will weaken the fabric. As for how often, that’s entirely up to you!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Q: Do three little buttons hold? Do crumbs fall out given the snack baggie gets tossed around in your bag?. A: For most snacks, including nuts, the pieces are big enough that they wont tend to fall out, even inside your bag.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Q: How big is one?. A: The snack measures about 17x17 cm square. It’s sized for a nice fat sandwich, and will fit a bagel, 1–2 donuts, a croissant, or a pain au chocolat. It mesnt to hold enough for person and is not family sized.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Got another question, let me know in the comments below!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Pictured: Strawberry 🍓 print snack baggie that’s going to @lyn_gm2 tomorrow!

B4E23ZWn5B6	*Reusables really spark joy more so than single-use*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. With the exception of one party that I hosted – my housewarming party, four years ago – I’ve never had company over and served food with single use because I think food and drink is enjoyed more eaten with “proper” plates, glasses, cutlery, serving dishes, etc. I enjoy the food more having the right implements, sitting down wherever possible, and enjoying conversation and company.  For me that’s being present in the moment. There’s more to wash after but meals are more enjoyable 💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. It’s different at hawkers. The concept of a hawker is affordable, fast and convenient. Does it matter then? Before I started my zero waste journey, I used to get take out from hawkers in single-use (that was normal I guess) and decant my food into proper plates and use the office cutlery. I realised that I don’t enjoy eating from disposable containers 😩. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. @etlchezzabelle got a coffee cup strap, cutlery pouch and snack baggie customised in the Japanese wave print fabric – this wave 🌊 print looks really nice and it might even be the next navy Asanoha!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m so encouraged to see an increased acceptance of BYO and people feeling proud to be ditching the disposables. Cheryl, I hope these bring you lots of joy and serve you well on your exciting new adventure ✈️. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. If you are considering getting a #stojo that goes with this print, the Carbon grey and Denim blue would look awesome with it (@eco_le_sg stock them so go check them out). For me, it looks pretty fab with my grey @Keepcup 🤗💛😁. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbaggie #reusablebag #reusablesnackbag #reusablefoodbag #reusablesandwichbag #reusablecoffeecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeetogo #coffeeonthego #zerowastecoffee #cutlerypouch #pouch #reusablepouch #reusablecutlery #reusable #reusables #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #flatlay #japanesewaves		#stojo | #snackbag | #snackbaggie | #reusablebag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablefoodbag | #reusablesandwichbag | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeetogo | #coffeeonthego | #zerowastecoffee | #cutlerypouch | #pouch | #reusablepouch | #reusablecutlery | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #flatlay | #japanesewaves	@etlchezzabelle | @eco_le_sg | @Keepcup	54	0	2019-10-26 17:10:42	False	False
B3_dJoQHN8H	*More unpaper towels*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I often get asked “Why are unpaper towels needed anyway?” I couldn’t really trace the etymology of this term but here’s my hypothesis.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. In most homes that I’ve been to in the US, kitchens are stocked exclusively with paper towels. Kitchen roll is used for wiping up tables after every meal, to blot moisture off meat (this I understand), as a barrier/separator so pots and pans don’t scratch each other when stored. Most US homes are dish washer enabled so hardly anything is hand washed and the next day when dishes come out, they don’t need further towel-drying.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The US paper towel market leader – Bounty – is also a really good product (compared to typical stuff available in Singapore), and the whole category has done a great job marketing the convenience and hygiene of single-use. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The next time you reach for that single use paper towel, have a think about whether you can find a reusable alternative!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #unpapertowel #unpaper #unpapertowels #clothwipes #reusablecloth #reusablewipes #unpapers #reusablecloths #reusables #reusable #cloth #cloths #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo #zerowastehacks #zerowastelifehacks #zerowastecloths. saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reducingwaste #zerowastegram #flaylay #cleankitchen #reusablekitchenwipes		#unpapertowel | #unpaper | #unpapertowels | #clothwipes | #reusablecloth | #reusablewipes | #unpapers | #reusablecloths | #reusables | #reusable | #cloth | #cloths | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastehacks | #zerowastelifehacks | #zerowastecloths | #saynotodisposables | #reducingwaste | #zerowastegram | #flaylay | #cleankitchen | #reusablekitchenwipes		32	3	2019-10-24 14:49:48	False	False

And you guys talk about it with me too, and I’m so thankful you feel comfortable enough to do that with me! 💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These pads (21.5 cm) were a surprise going-away gift from @thewanderingsigns to her friend. Since they’re are custom made, why not have the fabric prints say something meaningful? I love that someone put thought into fabric print that means something or conveys a message. We chose the waves because Hina’s friend is Japanese, and “bon voyage” started out as sea voyages; this print is much like traditional Japanese artists’ depiction of waves. The sloths – well, who doesn’t like a lie in, especially on the weekend? No judgement here!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Hina’s said “my friend loved it. Her squeals so loud and high lol.” It totally made my day. It’s really nice to be part of such lovely moments where good friends can gift each menstrual products! (Gifting a pack of disposable pads would convey a totally different message! 🤣). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. In my stories I shared a pic of this little guy. He doesn’t have a name (yet he’s got a gender). He’s a heat pack. I remove the inner pouch and heat it in the microwave. I used it to help with my cramping; thankfully the cramps are under control now. As always, please feel free to DM me with any questions.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B3yS-cDHGwg	*Food prints on food bags*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These two babies – an apple 🍎 print bread bag and a strawberry 🍓 print snack baggie – departed the Studio yesterday to their new home with @whoiscat! I hope they spark joy 💛💛💛 when you use them and that they come in handy on your journey to reducing unnecessary single-use plastic, especially at bakeries!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. This strawberry print is a new one. I’ve had the fabric for a bit but this is the first I’ve cut into to make something. I think it’s perfect for a snack baggie! I really like food prints on my food bags, especially because the snack baggies are waterproof so you can go to a fruit stall after lunch and get some cut fruit out directly inside. Washing the natural sugars from the fruit after eating is as simple as turning it inside out, a little dish soap (or I used hotel soap when I didn’t have dish soap in Beijing), and rinsing it!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. It’s great for getting snacks when you’re out and about (yes @playfull.sg, I’m talking about your @oldchangkeesingapore snacks that are so good and yet so bad).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. If you’ve been thinking about getting a snack baggie as a Christmas gift to encourage friends to BYO, please send me early DMs to avoid the Christmas crunch. They’re so easy to bring around, easy to clean and cute to look at that I think your friends will be converted in no time!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B3xtYi9p2NN	#Repost @insidethetinkerbox.  Sheena’s starting her journey with reusables liners and I’m always excited to be on that journey. For those of you who’ve been thinking about it, pantyliners are probably the easiest to start with, whether you’re an occasional user or a daily user. My liners are so breathable and comfortable they don’t feel like you’re wearing anything extra.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These two prints are fairly new and just so lovely (the vibe is quiet and ethereal), and remind me of the Studio Sanderson for Uniqlo collection, of which I have 2 floral tops. Do you know the collection?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. See that iridescent scissor? Thank you so much @urbanhikers for bringing that back from the US for me 💛. I discovered @tulapink about 6 months ago and fell in love with her hardware collection; the scissor cuts like a hot knife through butter.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m putting the sewing aside now for the day, and I’m going to a friend’s for a backyard (yes, he has a backyard!) barbecue! And just in case, I’ll be bringing my @keepcup (which probably won’t be used to contain coffee today), maybe cutlery. This is my first barbecue since embarking on a mission to reduce single-use waste but it is a home party. Wish me luck!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablepads #reusables #clothpads #pads #rumps #reusablepantyliners #pantyliner #reusablemenstrualproducts #pad #ecofriendlypads #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowasteperiods #zerowasteperiod #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastejourney #reusable #consciouschoices #saynotosingleuse #flatlay #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #happyperiod #happyperiods #freeherperiod		#Repost | #reusablepads | #reusables | #clothpads | #pads | #rumps | #reusablepantyliners | #pantyliner | #reusablemenstrualproducts | #pad | #ecofriendlypads | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowasteperiods | #zerowasteperiod | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastejourney | #reusable | #consciouschoices | #saynotosingleuse | #flatlay | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #happyperiod | #happyperiods | #freeherperiod	@insidethetinkerbox | @urbanhikers | @tulapink | @keepcup	12	0	2019-10-19 06:42:17	False	False
B3tneLknFap	*What would the world be like without _____?*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Back at Everton Park today for @nanalovesapples’s post dental check up and @nyloncoffee was a definite must-go. We’d planned the day out and I’d planned for an iced white so I brought my 12oz @keepcup (that’s mine with the paw print strap) and a straw. As usual, such friendly service from their staff who came out to say hi as she remembered me from the coffee cup straps! 🤗😁. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Didn’t get to have lunch at @meetpaul.sg because they moved and it took some time to track down their new location but I got to thinking..., “What would the world be like without _____?” (Insert your fave food.). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So many delicious things grow only under certain climate conditions, and with climate change, so many crops have perished from lack of rain, too much rain, blistering temperatures... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. What would the world be like without coffee? What would the world be like without avocados 🥑? What would the world be like if we just ate insects and beans? (Unfortunately, beans and I don’t get along much; I’d try an insect but I’m not that keen to.). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. What is your “what would the world be like without ____”?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #keepcup #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #tinkerboxinthewild #zerowasteshop #igsg #consciouschoices #designthinking #climatechangesolutions #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #makermovemet #coffeecupholder #eco		#bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #keepcup | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #tinkerboxinthewild | #zerowasteshop | #igsg | #consciouschoices | #designthinking | #climatechangesolutions | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #makermovemet | #coffeecupholder | #eco	@nanalovesapples | @nyloncoffee | @keepcup | @meetpaul.sg	50	5	2019-10-17 16:33:39	False	False

B3n9OM9nHuu	*Sewing frenzy resumes this afternoon*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I rushed out an order yesterday (and I’ll be posting a pic of it on Friday) but since Thursday last week, I’ve been working on something else for the Tinkerbox. It’s still a work-in-progress but hopefully it’ll meet MVP standards soon and I’ll be able to share it. Any guesses what I’ve been working on?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Here’s a set of liners that went out a couple of weeks ago to @aisyahi. The black small floral is a first for me. That fabric is from Mexico! To date, I curate and hand select all my fabrics personally – I like being able to feel the fabric on my fingers, ask the vendors questions, and be able to *share the provenance of each fabric you choose* with you. I have fabrics from the US, China, Uzbekistan, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Korea, and Singapore of course! I’m hoping to check out some fabrics across the causeway in Johor Bahru soon.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Today I’ll be working on snack baggies (I’m out now and have my snack baggie in my bag. Water bottle too but totally forgot my @keepcup. Thankfully I’ll be dining in at @wakeysg so I won’t need it.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Hope you like these prints ! They’re slightly bolder than some of my pastels. It’s so difficult to choose a favourite! Which one of these is your favourite?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablepads #reusables #clothpads #pads #rumps #reusablepantyliners #pantyliner #reusablemenstrualproducts #pad #ecofriendlypads #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowasteperiods #zerowasteperiod #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastejourney #reusable #consciouschoices #saynotosingleuse #flatlay #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #happyperiod #happyperiods #zerowasteinspo #happyvibes #sparkjoy		#reusablepads | #reusables | #clothpads | #pads | #rumps | #reusablepantyliners | #pantyliner | #reusablemenstrualproducts | #pad | #ecofriendlypads | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowasteperiods | #zerowasteperiod | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastejourney | #reusable | #consciouschoices | #saynotosingleuse | #flatlay | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #happyperiod | #happyperiods | #zerowasteinspo | #happyvibes | #sparkjoy	@aisyahi | @keepcup | @wakeysg	40	6	2019-10-15 11:48:16	False	False

B3it9BXHCmd	*Every home needs unpaper towels*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. When I first showed my unpaper towels to my dad he called them “rags” but in my head, rags are... ratty and tattered. I looked the word up and the Oxford Dictionary says that rags are old cloths, typically torn from a larger piece. I wouldn’t consider unpaper towels and rags one and the same, though the difference is arguably small; I’d use a clean rag on a kitchen surface but I wouldn’t use an unpaper towel to wipe my hands dirty from motor oil.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve been thinking about how paper towel is used to absorb the excess oil from fried food (my mom makes the best fried wontons 😋). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. If you wanted to use an unpaper towel for excess oil absorption I’d recommend:. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. • for not-so-oily foods a wire mesh tray (think tempura or katsu I’m good Japanese restaurants). • a few unpaper towels dedicated to food, preferably in darker shades with more robust patterns. Use the terry side as the oil will show up less obviously.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. And for those of you who have an one, fried wontons are a cinch to make in an air fryer. I fold my wontons into a triangle for max surface area crisping; don’t be tempted to wet the skin with water – excess water will turn into steam and you’ll end up with soggy wontons. Air fried wontons aren’t as crisp as their oil fried counterpart but in my opinion, they’re ~80% as good and well worth the 20% sacrifice. Less oil and less cleaning up are a definite win in my book.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These unpaper towels are on their way to @gracetsanggg. I hope you find lots of joy in using them 💛💛💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #unpapertowel #unpapertowels #clothwipes #reusablecloth #reusablewipes #unpapers #reusablecloths #reusables #reusable #cloth #cloths #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo #zerowastehacks #zerowastelifehacks #zerowastecloths. saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reducingwaste #zerowastegram #flaylay #cleankitchen #reusablekitchenwipes #donuts		#unpapertowel | #unpapertowels | #clothwipes | #reusablecloth | #reusablewipes | #unpapers | #reusablecloths | #reusables | #reusable | #cloth | #cloths | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastehacks | #zerowastelifehacks | #zerowastecloths | #saynotodisposables | #reducingwaste | #zerowastegram | #flaylay | #cleankitchen | #reusablekitchenwipes | #donuts	@gracetsanggg	51	2	2019-10-13 10:58:39	False	False

B3a-IE1n-3E	*Keeping food waste to a minimum*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I love making new dishes from “fridge food” so that I don’t waste food. My veggie staples are broccoli, cauliflower, celery, carrot, bell pepper, and cabbage because these veggies last in the fridge, especially now that I’ve discovered they last longer stored in my salad bag (that I bought but honestly it’s just a terry cloth bag 🤣🤣🤣 but it *does* work wonders and cabbage lasts 3 weeks).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Here’s some penne (from @eco_le_sg) with leftover stuff – shmeiji mushrooms, celery, sausage – in a tomato sauce. I find the tomatoes in Singapore lacking punch so I prefer to use pasata when making tomato-based pastas; I find that a little goes a long way. I wasn’t too hungry at dinner so the leftovers were out aside for lunch the next day. Leftovers are great because —> less food waste and fewer dishes to wash (I hate doing dishes).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Had my lunch with some sparkling water with lemon. I have a @sodastreamsingapore because I love sparkling water and I didn’t want to buy multiple small plastic bottles of it (with sparkling water, it loses its sparkle if you don’t consume it quickly enough so getting a large bottle doesn’t work). Lovely on a crazy hot day.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Some unpaper towel minis – unpaper towels are kitchen essentials for spills and drips and all that gooey, mucky kitchen stuff. The black on white dashed line print is playfully sophisticated and perfect for @3mm.montessori’s brand and the minis are great for small hands. These were commissioned by Jasmine for her coaching clients!

B3OU3iwnwmm	*The rest of my Saturday 💛🌈🤗💐*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I woke up at 7:15 am or so this morning, early considering I don’t have pressing plans but rather the norm. I usually start sewing in the morning as soon as I’ve had some coffee ☕️, and completed some lovely botanical print pads and liners for @ceeteee and @kumokoyun (swipe 👈). Sheena’s starting her journey with reusables liners and I’m always excited to be on that journey. For those of you who’ve been thinking about it, pantyliners are probably the easiest to start with, whether you’re an occasional user or a daily user. My liners are so breathable and comfortable they don’t feel like you’re wearing anything extra.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These two prints are fairly new and just so lovely (the vibe is quiet and ethereal), and remind me of the Studio Sanderson for Uniqlo collection, of which I have 2 floral tops. Do you know the collection?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. See that iridescent scissor? Thank you so much @urbanhikers for bringing that back from the US for me 💛. I discovered @tulapink about 6 months ago and fell in love with her hardware collection; the scissor cuts like a hot knife through butter.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m putting the sewing aside now for the day, and I’m going to a friend’s for a backyard (yes, he has a backyard!) barbecue! And just in case, I’ll be bringing my @keepcup (which probably won’t be used to contain coffee today), maybe cutlery. This is my first barbecue since embarking on a mission to reduce single-use waste but it is a home party.

So instead of trying to untangle the mess of thoughts in my head, I’d like to say that I never thought I’d love sewing as much as I do (when I was a kid and had to sew in school, my mother took my project to a seamstress and asked her to make a few mistakes so that “it looks like my daughter made this”). Yet here I am with handmade reusable alternative solutions to single-use problems.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. And in this, I find my purpose 💛💛💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. @ceeteeee ordered this liner and I’m so excited because I love her enthusiasm and her conviction, and I think this liner is so very her.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Happy weekend everyone and I hope you’re all living colourfully, even if your favourite colours are black and white! 💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #rainbow #rainbowpantyliner #pantyliner #pantyliners #reusablepantyliner #reusablepantyliners #reusablepads #reusablemenstrualproducts #tumps #livecolorfully #livecolourfully #reusable #reusables #reusablealternatives #saynotosingleuse #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowasteinspo #flatlay #climatechangeisreal #livingmybestlife #sustainable #everylittlecounts #makingadifference #makermovement #maker #makersgonnamake #katespadelivecolorfully #katespadequote		#rainbow | #rainbowpantyliner | #pantyliner | #pantyliners | #reusablepantyliner | #reusablepantyliners | #reusablepads | #reusablemenstrualproducts | #tumps | #livecolorfully | #livecolourfully | #reusable | #reusables | #reusablealternatives | #saynotosingleuse | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowasteinspo | #flatlay | #climatechangeisreal | #livingmybestlife | #sustainable | #everylittlecounts | #makingadifference | #makermovement | #maker | #makersgonnamake | #katespadelivecolorfully | #katespadequote	@ceeteeee	39	0	2019-10-04 14:02:41	False	False
B3JrXdUnokB	*Do these look like dried apricots 🍑 to you?*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I was in Uzbekistan a year ago; my partner by himself about 6 months ago and to Kyrgyzstan more recently. I’m not a big fan of dried fruit but we did get some when we were there. These browny fruit with pits were were in the “point to pick” fruit haul and we didn’t really know what they were – we just pointed! Turns out, they’re dried apricots!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Even though I’m not a fan, I recognised dried apricots as flat, bright orange circles, so we postulated that these might be peaches. We finally found out that they were apricots in Kyrgyzstan, along with the why that I hadn’t known about dried fruit.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The bright orange hue of dried apricots comes from sulphur dioxide which is a preservative. It preserves colour as well as fruit. A quick search says that light (coloured) dried fruit is provably preserved with SO2, such as golden raisins.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m not equipped with the science behind whether SO2 is safe (it seems safe for most, with the exception of people with respiratory ailments like asthma). I did read on a bulletin that people in the dried fruit business prefer the non-sulphite method of drying fruit for taste though it’s more expensive. If you know, write about it, I’d be interested to find out.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Brand new pattern: remember my blue monsteras? They brought in a green version. I wonder if I played a part because I kept urging him to source for it. Snack baggies are great for dried fruit (and nuts) if you like em! Or a whole other host of yummies to. Be creative!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #donut #donuts #snackbag #snackbags #reusablesandwichbags #foodbag #reusablesnackbag #reusablesnackbags #zerowaste #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastesnacking #zerowasteonthego #reusable #reusables #reducewaste #consciouschoices #shoplocal #artisan #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplatic #saynotodisposables #saynotoplasticbags #flatlay #zerowasteinspo #driedapricots		#donut | #donuts | #snackbag | #snackbags | #reusablesandwichbags | #foodbag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablesnackbags | #zerowaste | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastesnacking | #zerowasteonthego | #reusable | #reusables | #reducewaste | #consciouschoices | #shoplocal | #artisan | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplatic | #saynotodisposables | #saynotoplasticbags | #flatlay | #zerowasteinspo | #driedapricots		52	0	2019-10-03 17:35:02	False	False
B3GVfIAHZd4	*Hot! ☀️🔥*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The romantic way of looking at #endlesssummer is summer holidays, beaches, long daylight hours, cocktails with umbrellas in them 🍹, and paradise. And in Singapore, the heat 🔥 and humidity 💦.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. To mitigate this, I started being more conscious of the material(s) my clothes were made from, prioritising natural over synthetic. Cottons I knew, and I grew fond of linen, a fabric I had previously reserved for explorer types (think Indiana Jones’ sidekick).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Cotton and linen are lovely, natural fibres that, when made into clothes, allow skin to breathe and perspiration to evaporate. This improves the comfort quotient of your clothes. Why shouldn’t liners be breathable too?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My pads and liners are made of different types of cotton fabric. The liner is exclusively woven cotton, and the pad is deliberately layered with different weaves of cotton to maximise speed of absorption and quantity absorbed.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Natural fabrics frees me to feel more comfortable throughout the day, and pretty prints make me happy. If you’re in the tropics, enjoy the endless summer 🏖 and bring a handheld fan with you for too-hot days. It’s incredibly more effective than using a piece of paper to fan yourself!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablepantyliners #reusablepads #reusables #clothpads #pads #prettypads #rumps #pad #yellow #ecofriendlypads #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowastelifestyle #zerowasteperiod #zerlwasteinspo #happyperiods #reusable #consciouschoices #shopsg #saynotosingleuse  #saynotodisposables #ecofriendly #flatlay #pineappleprints #prettypantyliners #prettypads		#endlesssummer | #reusablepantyliners | #reusablepads | #reusables | #clothpads | #pads | #prettypads | #rumps | #pad | #yellow | #ecofriendlypads | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowasteperiod | #zerlwasteinspo | #happyperiods | #reusable | #consciouschoices | #shopsg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #ecofriendly | #flatlay | #pineappleprints | #prettypantyliners | #prettypads		54	7	2019-10-02 10:26:07	False	False

B3B7LPoHgKn	*Sometimes 30 cents is worth more than a dollar*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The guys at @nyloncoffee are absolutely lovely, and one of their team recognised me when I went back in the afternoon for my second cup! (We had dropped @nanalovesapples off for dental work in the morning and were picking her up in the afternoon).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Nylon is another coffee shop that encourage #byo. They give you 30 cents off for bringing your own cup in, but are always happy to serve it in one of their cups of you’re drinking it there.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. For me, it’s not the dollar value of the discount that attests to your sustainability intentions, and I’m happier with Nylon’s 30 cents than I am with @coffeebeansg’s $1. Why’s that?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I recently ordered a drink from the Coffee Bean and the cashier assured me that I can get my drink in a reusable cup. It sounded like a good plan, so I said yes. When I looked into the kitchen, I saw their staff making my drink in a single-use plastic cup and I exclaimed. They heard me and said that they needed to, in order to measure the ingredients out 🤔. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. To me, this was an example a large organisation not having a central and overarching sustainability policy. My theory: Operations continued to use single-use with the discount taken from Corporate Social Responsibility’s budget. To me, it seems like a lack of education, incentive and process for Coffee Bean  as a whole to be more sustainable in light of today’s plastic single-use crisis.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Nylon, I’ll be back next week for Nana’s follow up! Thank you for the lovely conversation and the good coffee.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #keepcup #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #tinkerboxinthewild #zerowasteshop #igsg #consciouschoices #designthinking #climatechangesolutions #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #maker		#byo | #bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #keepcup | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #tinkerboxinthewild | #zerowasteshop | #igsg | #consciouschoices | #designthinking | #climatechangesolutions | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #maker	@nyloncoffee | @nanalovesapples | @coffeebeansg	41	13	2019-09-30 17:19:15	False	False

B2_YI75nzvd	*An afternoon of watermelons 🍉 & strawberries 🍓, earl grey tea and 🐶💛*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I think I’be finally stopped sewing for the day. It’s early evening and round 2 of the storm has hit, with massive lightning flashes and roaring thunder. @nanalovesapples is terrified of storms; she’s been sitting close to me – by my feet in the studio or, like now, next to me on the sofa.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I love this set of watermelon and liners! Liners hold a special space in my heart because it’s through this that I realised the quantitative enormity of my own waste and that even though each piece of trash may seem small, it accumulates. Since I was sewing for @sevaseed and attending events, I decided that I had to try to them because I couldn’t authentically advocate something I had no first hand knowledge of!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. This lovely set, along with a yellow themed set (pictures soon) will be headed to @jengnerous soon. I’m so excited! The watermelon 🍉 prints have been *really* popular so I’m running out of some of them. DM me to find out what else is available before I completely run out!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablepantyliners #reusablepads #reusables #clothpads #pads #prettypads #rumps #pad #unbleachedcotton #ecofriendlypads #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowastelifestyle #zerowasteperiod #zerlwasteinspo #happyperiods #reusable #consciouschoices #shopsg #saynotosingleuse  #saynotodisposables #ecofriendly #flatlay #rainbowpastel #watermelonprints #shotoniphone #iphonexphotography		#reusablepantyliners | #reusablepads | #reusables | #clothpads | #pads | #prettypads | #rumps | #pad | #unbleachedcotton | #ecofriendlypads | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowasteperiod | #zerlwasteinspo | #happyperiods | #reusable | #consciouschoices | #shopsg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #ecofriendly | #flatlay | #rainbowpastel | #watermelonprints | #shotoniphone | #iphonexphotography	@nanalovesapples | @sevaseed | @jengnerous	43	9	2019-09-29 17:34:37	False	False

B26PT-0nrWn	*Happy Friyay, happy period*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Yay it’s the weekend! Do you look forward to weeeknds? Even though as a small business owner, I work practically every day, I look forward to my weekends as much as I look forward to working – measuring, drawing, cutting, sewing, and chatting with you guys! Making reusable alternatives for you guys gives me purpose and makes me extremely happy. Thank you for liking my work! 🙏. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. But why do I say happy period? Periods are usually a dreaded week in every woman’s life, and there are good reasons. Hormones make you tired, or greedy or grouchy or all of the above. For me, it’s the sticky feeling that I hate, needing to think about changing pads, and cramps!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Reduced toxins from single-use pads or tampons (with way too much plastic in them) have helped me personally with the reduction of Nabothian cysts (my gynaecologist was pleased). And though I can’t get away from changing pads, the pretty, prints make a difference 🤗🤗🤗 My favourite prints make me smile and bring lots of joy! 🤗💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Pictured, some pads that went out to @thewanderingsigns and @mishiscripts. I hope they make your periods happier periods 😍🤗💛 Happy weekend everyone 🥰. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablepads #reusables #clothpads #pads #rumps #reusablemenstrualproducts #pad #ecofriendlypads #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowasteperiods #zerowasteperiod #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastejourney #reusable #consciouschoices #saynotosingleuse #flatlay #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #happyperiod #happyperiods #watermelonprints #catprints #zerowasteinspo #happyfriyay #weekendvibes		#reusablepads | #reusables | #clothpads | #pads | #rumps | #reusablemenstrualproducts | #pad | #ecofriendlypads | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowasteperiods | #zerowasteperiod | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastejourney | #reusable | #consciouschoices | #saynotosingleuse | #flatlay | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #happyperiod | #happyperiods | #watermelonprints | #catprints | #zerowasteinspo | #happyfriyay | #weekendvibes	@thewanderingsigns | @mishiscripts	60	15	2019-09-27 17:41:17	False	False

B239h3-nMWf	*Keepcup/Stojo*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I wish the Unicode Consortium would update their coffee-moji (add a reusable cup?) – I’d use it *all the time*!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Coffee in cities is so ubiquitous; the disposable coffee cup had become a status symbol, “I’m busy being fabulous, far too busy to sit down for coffee so I’ll get mine to go”.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Brits drink more than 8m takeout coffees a day. 25b cups are thrown away in the US. @Starbucks US still (I witnessed this in  January 2019) had recycling bins for cups but exposées have shown that they just get sent to landfill.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. If you’re drinking anything in a disposable coffee cup (or in Asia a plastic bag), please get a reusable coffee cup! Many of you will have your own - yay! if you’re still on the fence, I recommend @keepcup (my preferred) and @stojo.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Keepcup pros: replaceable/ interchangeable parts, limited wear and tear, choice of glass or plastic cup.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Keepcup cons: not leak proof, glass weighs more, takes up more space, plastic shows tea stains, some garish colours.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Stojo pros: collapses to take up less space, leak proof (no, don’t put a full cup of coffee into your bag, but it keeps coffee dregs inside after you finish), much better choice of colours.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Stojo cons: Mechanical wear and tear of the silicone from repeated collapsing, propensity for silicone to absorb smells, discolouration (less obvious on darker models), top heavy design more prone to topping, especially the Biggie.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I like these but whatever you choose, it’s a step in the right direction. And it’s nice when coffeeshops give you a discount!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #keepcup #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #tinkerboxinthewild #zerowasteshop #igsg #consciouschoices #designthinking #climatechangesolutions #butfirstcoffee #zerowastemaker #makermovemet #coffeecupholder #eco		#bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #keepcup | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #tinkerboxinthewild | #zerowasteshop | #igsg | #consciouschoices | #designthinking | #climatechangesolutions | #butfirstcoffee | #zerowastemaker | #makermovemet | #coffeecupholder | #eco	@Starbucks | @keepcup | @stojo	64	2	2019-09-26 20:27:25	False	False
B20---YHBES	*Some favourite things*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Hi guys, it feels like it’s been a while since I posted anything, but I’ve been squirrelling away in the background, prepping, sewing 🧵 , popping up, and recovering from my third cold 🤧in two-ish weeks (thankfully these have been 24 or 36 hour bugs).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Just finished taking a picture of this set of goodies that’s headed to @joeyhah – snack baggies, liners, a 26cm pad, and some facial cotton alternatives; I love this picture because two (of three) of some of favourite things are represented in this pic 💛💛💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Some of my favourite things:. 1. You guys might know that my favourite colour is unabashedly pink and there’s loads of pink going on here 💞💓💗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. 2. I love finding great fabrics and when I saw this New York City fabric, I had to get it even though I’d have preferred a non-directional fabric for versatility. NYC is one of my favourite cities and I’m lucky that I know it pretty well now 🌆🗽🚕. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. 3. Thankful that it’s rained (poured, thundered). My half-dry clothes got wet but the weather’s waaay cooler and I hope this helps put the green back into the grass.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The work isn’t over. There’s loads more to do. Stay tuned for updates and keep fighting the good fight!

B2tR_OmHbzq	*New snack baggie fabric patterns!*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m so excited to share these freshly minted snack baggies in new fabric prints –🍦🍎🍉🦌. Team Ice Cream. Won out but only slightly over Team Apples. And I have more (new) watermelons and a new woodland print! Which is your favourite? I think I’d have to pick the apples and the watermelons, and prioritise the apples because I 💛 pink!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. What would you put in your snack baggie? I don’t often buy buns from bakeries (I buy either baguette or full loaves of sour dough); I do love a good pain au chocolat and kouign-amman (swipe 👈).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B2glTqXH8Cp	*💛 the colour, will skip the tea*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Mint has such oh-so sophisticated associations, think After Eight chocolates; adults get the minty toothpastes and kids the fruity (incidentally, when I get my teeth cleaned at the dentist, they know to use children’s strawberry 🍓 on me); mint as an after-dinner tea. Me: the only thing I like about mint is the modern day popular pastel colour, which is really different from the mossy green of actual mint.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve had this pastel mint green star fabric for a while now and only just started working on it for some liners for @shuyikwok. I love the colour. I cut more of this for more liners, as I’ll be at an MBS internal sustainability pop up with @eco_le_sg and @minimakers.sg 🤗 next Monday-Wednesday after F1 (how exciting!) and will also have a few things at my cousin’s Garage Sale (Sun, 22 Sep, swipe 👈👈). Head down if you want to check out some pre-loved stuff (my cousin has great taste!). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So I’m saying yes to white stars 🌟 on mint green liners and skipping the mint tea in favour of some chai as I’m down with a cold.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. What’s your favourite colour? And what’s your favourite tea? Mine pink and earl grey 💛💛💛 ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablepantyliners #reusablepads #reusables #clothpads #pads #prettypads #rumps #pad #unbleachedcotton #ecofriendlypads #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowastelifestyle #zerowasteperiod #zerlwasteinspo #happyperiods #reusable #consciouschoices #shopsg #saynotosingleuse  #saynotodisposables #ecofriendly #flatlay #rainbowpastel #prettypantyliners #prettypads #mintgreen		#reusablepantyliners | #reusablepads | #reusables | #clothpads | #pads | #prettypads | #rumps | #pad | #unbleachedcotton | #ecofriendlypads | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowasteperiod | #zerlwasteinspo | #happyperiods | #reusable | #consciouschoices | #shopsg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #ecofriendly | #flatlay | #rainbowpastel | #prettypantyliners | #prettypads | #mintgreen	@shuyikwok | @eco_le_sg | @minimakers.sg	47	4	2019-09-17 18:33:13	False	False
B2eK9PElk7P	So I was asked to choose an 'on-the-house' add-on for my KL Spicy Noodles takeout. Because I had my #reusable container with me that's why, oh what a pleasant surprise ! Only then did I notice the posters as the stallholder prepared the hand-pinched noods topped with my Sous Vide Egg🏆. The fact that the pop-up stall has also ditched single-use plastics completely, with all takeouts on a #byo basis really made my day. Now if only MORE small business owners embrace such eco-forward gestures.... Hot coffee in my trusty old @stojo cup. Finally breaking out my #stojobiggie Asanoha strap #tinkerboxinthewild 🥢. .. .. #byo #byobox #lunchbox #reusablelunchbox #byokit #bringyourown #ibringmyownsg #bringyourownkit #byocup #bringyourowncup #reusablecup #reusable #reusables #ecolife #ecofriendly #ecolifestyle #nosingleuse #reduceplastic #whatsinmybag #byosingapore #stojocup .. .. .. .		#reusable | #byo | #stojobiggie | #tinkerboxinthewild | #byo | #byobox | #lunchbox | #reusablelunchbox | #byokit | #bringyourown | #ibringmyownsg | #bringyourownkit | #byocup | #bringyourowncup | #reusablecup | #reusable | #reusables | #ecolife | #ecofriendly | #ecolifestyle | #nosingleuse | #reduceplastic | #whatsinmybag | #byosingapore | #stojocup	@stojo	37	6	2019-09-16 20:04:29	False	False

B2bjn9-nQ_v	*Happy weekend*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m thankful that the haze is better today that it was yesterday. I’d gone out to Chinatown yesterday and when lunch was over, the sky was tinged yellow-grey and smelled horribly acrid. We holed ourselves up in AC the rest of the day and went to sleep early.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Woke up early today and finally got a haircut. I got about 5 inches chopped off and now I sport a short bob because it was too hot with hair on my neck. Climate change and global warming are real.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Highlights of my weekend include: getting my hands on some lovely fabric, stopping by @troveofgai’s and @sundayshirt_’s pop ups, finally getting my hands on a thermal stainless steel flask, and a coffee in my Keepcup from @ppp.coffee. The coffee cup strap means I didn’t accidentally leave my coffee cup behind while window shopping!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Bring a one-woman “I make everything myself” small business, I know how awesome it is when someone likes your stuff enough to buy something from you. I’ve been thinking about getting a thermal bottle for two months and am really happy with @bamboostrawgirl‘s. It’s been 3.5 hours and my ice cubes (omg the mouth of the bottle is wide enough for ice cubes!!) are still cubes inside my flask of iced tea and there’s no condensation on my sewing table. I also really like that there’s a handle on the cap.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. It’s always really nice to be able to support as local a business as possible and I’m really proud to be part of a local community of zero waste makers, bulk foods, and sustainable business owners 💪. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #bringyourown #reusables #reusablecoffeecup #coffee #keepcup #reusablecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeecupcarrier #coffeecupholder #zerowastecoffee #zerowasteonthego #zerowaste #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reusable #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #tinkerboxinthewild #zerowasteshop #igsg #consciouschoices #designthinking #climatechangesolutions #butforstcoffee #weekendvibes #zerowastemaker #makermovement #coffeecupholder		#bringyourown | #reusables | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffee | #keepcup | #reusablecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeecupcarrier | #coffeecupholder | #zerowastecoffee | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowaste | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #reusable | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #tinkerboxinthewild | #zerowasteshop | #igsg | #consciouschoices | #designthinking | #climatechangesolutions | #butforstcoffee | #weekendvibes | #zerowastemaker | #makermovement | #coffeecupholder	@troveofgai | @sundayshirt_ | @ppp.coffee | @bamboostrawgirl	74	6	2019-09-15 19:42:19	False	False

I am on my last shreds of this much loved rubber duckie fabric and I haven’t been able to get more (on my last trip to the shop, I didn’t see any but I’ll try again tomorrow). I do have a brand new (and very cute) duck print but I have to say, the rubber duckies *simply are* exceptionally cute!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’be received many nice comments about my photography 🙏 I use my phone’s camera, I try to use what I have, and my preference is to shoot in natural light. For this picture today, I knew I didn’t want to buy rubber duckies just for a picture. My cousin lives in the next block; lo and behind, she had rubber duckies from a previous art project that I could use!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B2L1hryH8ZU	*New home for these two snack baggies*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. One of the nicest things about being a small business owner is being able to know my customers as people, as friends. And having them know me too! I don’t know if/how this will change but for now, I am really happy that I do.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These two snack baggies – the pink watermelons and sharks (🍩🍩🍩 not included) – will be making their way to @andreeyah__ (damn those underscores). I’m so excited. Talking to her has been really nice and I’m also impressed that she took her time to think about whether she needed one. I know my prints are cute and that’s a big draw but it’s good to know that you guys are thinking about what you need and will use.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I use my snack baggie all the time! Because I’m already carrying loads with my water bottle (and maybe @keepcup), I don’t want to carry a food container around with me all the time. It doesn’t help that most of my food containers are glass and I’m not a fan of the collapsible though I can see how handy they’d be! I took my snack to @backtogroundzero and got a lemon sea salt crumble from @welldressedsaladbar in it! (It was really good!). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Many of you have bought snack baggies from me in all sorts of prints (each one is my favourite, I promise!) and I’d love to know what you use yours for! If you take a pic of it and want to share it on @instagram, please tag me at @insidethetinkerbox and hashtag #tinkerboxinthewild! 💛💛💛 I’d really appreciate the tag!

B2If7Afnn2Q	*A morning without rush*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. It’s been a really busy weekend but I’ve finally Sunday to wake up to calm, no rushing around needing to walk @nanalovesapples, who’s staycationing at my parents’, or rushing to a one-hour bus journey.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Scrubbed my face with a face scrub from @rootsofjoyshop (mixed in an old  @awfullychocolatesg ramekin that was too good to discard with @oasisskin’s small spatula that I absolutely love).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Since working full time on the Tinkerbox, I haven’t had much need for makeup, and I’ve been really happy about that because make up just slides off my skin. I’ve switched to reusable facial cotton pads when I clean but my skincare routine is still alarmingly lacking.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve heard it from the beauty blogging world that if skin is greasy, adding an oil to your skincare routine actually helps; surface dryness stimulates an over production of sebum which results in a greasy face. Yes, get that. Tried it. Hadn’t really worked. What I didn’t understand is different oils have different molecule sizes that work for different skin types! Aha moment. I’m happy to report that I’ve been using Oasis Skin’s Instaglow (about 50% of the time) and am really happy with how it feels. Send them a DM or visit the shop because Hildra will explain things much better than I can.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My reusable facial cotton pads are made form remnant fabric from larger projects. I don’t usually make them specially but I do have them often. If I’m at a pop up (which I will be in Sep and Oct, details to follow), you can pick and choose or I’ll send you a mixed prints if you place an order.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Have a happy Sunday! 💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowastejourney #zerowastebathroom #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastehacks #zerowastealternatives #zerowastetravel #facialrounds #cottonfacepads #reusables #saynotosingleuse #stylemepretty #makermovement #flatlay #eco #zerowasteinspo #zakka #shopsg #sgmaker #makermovement #weekendvibes #weekend		#zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastebathroom | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastehacks | #zerowastealternatives | #zerowastetravel | #facialrounds | #cottonfacepads | #reusables | #saynotosingleuse | #stylemepretty | #makermovement | #flatlay | #eco | #zerowasteinspo | #zakka | #shopsg | #sgmaker | #makermovement | #weekendvibes | #weekend	@nanalovesapples | @rootsofjoyshop | @awfullychocolatesg | @oasisskin	37	5	2019-09-08 10:04:23	False	False

B2BYj9inODv	*Cover and keep*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Finally made “proper” dinner last night. I’m quite bad at feeding myself properly when It’s just dinner for one – the effort for one portion or two is the same. And I hate doing dishes where my hands are in prolonged contact with dish washing liquid and water because I have dyshidrotic eczema – tiny blisters form on my hands that itch crazily!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I looked at the two peppers 🌶 in my fridge last night trying to decide if one would do, but I love food that’s visually pleasing, so I decided to go for both colours. I knew I wouldn’t be able to finish all of it so I set aside half for tonight’s dinner, and here’s where bowl covers come in handy.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Bees wax wraps are really popular in place of cling wrap and I have some myself, but they’ll need rewaxing over time, so I save that to wrap fruit and veg (like lemon because I never use up a whole lemon 🍋 at one go and they keep weeks wrapped in a beeswax wrap).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These cotton bowl covers are useful for avoiding condensed liquid dripping back onto your food. A few weeks ago, I baked a cake in a loaf tin and was taking it across town. I didn’t want to end up with soggy cake, so I popped on one of my bowl covers over a cake loaf tin. Not only did it do the job, I was thrilled that the round cover was versatile enough to use on a rectangular tin.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. As for my salad, it’s Uzbek inspired (Uzbek salads 💛💛💛). Mixed peppers, sliced thinly,. Drizzle with sesame oil. Salt and pepper to taste. (I’m not a fan of the typical honey mustard or balsamic dressings). Try this salad 🤗👌👍. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusables #reusable #reduce #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastelife #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney #zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo #saynotosingleuse #saynotoclingwrap #saynotoclingfilm #saynotodisposables #saynotofoodwaste #saynotosingleuseplastic #flatlay #bowlcover #bowlcovers #foodstorage #shopsg #shoplocal #conciouschoices #choosereusable #beeswaxwrap #salad		#reusables | #reusable | #reduce | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastelife | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastelife | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotoclingwrap | #saynotoclingfilm | #saynotodisposables | #saynotofoodwaste | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #flatlay | #bowlcover | #bowlcovers | #foodstorage | #shopsg | #shoplocal | #conciouschoices | #choosereusable | #beeswaxwrap | #salad		41	6	2019-09-05 15:45:24	False	False
B1_Dcobns3r	What’s in your bag?. . . This week, we asked staff at our headquarters to share with us what they have been doing to save the earth. It is not surprising to find them reducing the use of plastics. Let’s look at some of the things we found in their bags:. . . Pic 1: Bertrand has foldable shopping bags in his backpack. He has them for moments of last-minute grocery shopping. His water bottle is also in his bag. When thirsty, he would not need to buy packet drinks or bottled water.. . . Pic 2: Jorain brings her breakfast from home, packed in a reusable container. She also uses her own cutleries for she believes in using less plastic. She also carries a tote bag when going out for lunch so she does not need 5o take plastic bags after shopping. She can just place them into her tote bag.. . . Pic 3: Beatrice is well prepared as she has a lot of items in her bag. Metal straws, foldable shopping bag, two water bottles; one for water and the other for coffee/tea.. . . Pic 4: Lastly, Gail has everything reusable in her bag; her water bottle, reusable containers, and shopping bags. See how she also keeps her items in pouches!. . . We hope our little actions will inspire you to join us to care for our Common Home.. . . PS: No bags were ransacked during this activity.😜 #caritassingapore #caritassg #caritasasia #caritas #laudatosi #careforourcommonhome #whatsinyourbag #whatiscaritasdoing #lessplastics #reusables		#caritassingapore | #caritassg | #caritasasia | #caritas | #laudatosi | #careforourcommonhome | #whatsinyourbag | #whatiscaritasdoing | #lessplastics | #reusables		18	0	2019-09-04 18:02:25	False	False
B1-mFiHnaNB	Restocked!. #REPOST  @insidethetinkerbox with @get__repost__app *A few quiet moments*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve just finished the “mandatories”  day – walking the dog, cleaning her paws, feeding her, giving her meds, putting the washed sofa cover back on, and clearing the kitchen (I wanted to brew jasmine tea and my teapot hadn’t been washed out since the last I made tea 😖) .. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Now i’m sitting on the sofa with with a fresh pot of tea and a warm @nanalovesapples next to me (she wanted upsies on the sofa), taking a few moments before sewing frenzy starts.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Over the last two days, I finished up a big batch of pantyliners. The lovely custom order of 13 liners is going to @carriep25 in and she got the rubber duckies 🐥 for her best friend!

I’ve also just restocked at @eco_le_sg 🤗🤗🤗 so if you’re in Singapore and want to see and feel what they’re like in person, you can head over to Bukit Timah Shopping Centre; HH’s shop is always such a welcoming space.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Yesterday when I was sewing, I completely forgot about the time. In positive psychology, it’s called a state of flow (being in the zone). It wouldn’t be possible without you so thank you for being here with me 💛😍🤗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B10ETrTlbuh	| @scoopwholefoods_sg |. So there is an Aussie wholefoods store in town that we've been frequenting since they opened. Where you can shop for package-free organic & natural condiments, dried produce, honey, nut butter, sweets and treats by weight. Meaning, you can buy as little or as much as you need, a good way to keep food fresh and reduce food wastage.. .. What's more, you can #byo storage options. After determining the tare weight of each of my #reusables, we loaded my Stasher bags with:.. • Pretzels from Egypt, really? (110g), $1.65 - addictive!. • Kri Kri Chilli Nuts (152g), $2.28. • Vegetable Chips (150g), $6.75 - vacuum-fried purple sweet potato, carrot, squash, taro and long bean - my 'salad' fave, can't stop munching!. .. And for the small #reusable jars:.. • 73% Dark Chocolate Peanut Balls (142g), $4.97 and.. • Tulsi or sacred basil Tea Leaf (12g), $1.14 . Great size for sampling (like 12g of tea), storage and portion control !. .. Meanwhile, a refuelling stop at Brunetti Coffee is in order, with a Piccolo Latte ☕ in my #byocup.. .. I like @ScoopWholefoods_Sg loose tea range especially - previously picked up 300g of Earl Grey Rose Lavender Tea on top of Pink Himalayan Rock Salt, Queensland Beer Nuts and bamboo straws, among other things. Tried the on-tap Lemon Lavender and Turmeric Tonic Kombucha (fermented black tea) too... lovely 😏.. .. .. ✅ Saved: 5 paper bags, 1 paper cup & lid.. .. #byo #byokit #bringyourown #ibringmyownsg #bringyourownkit #byobag #byobsg #byosingapore #reusable #reusables #ecolife #ecofriendly #ecolifestyle #whatsinmybag #bulkbin #bulkstore #packagefree #reduceplastic #organicfoods #stasherbag. .. .		#byo | #reusables | #reusable | #byocup | #byo | #byokit | #bringyourown | #ibringmyownsg | #bringyourownkit | #byobag | #byobsg | #byosingapore | #reusable | #reusables | #ecolife | #ecofriendly | #ecolifestyle | #whatsinmybag | #bulkbin | #bulkstore | #packagefree | #reduceplastic | #organicfoods | #stasherbag	@scoopwholefoods_sg | @ScoopWholefoods_Sg	52	5	2019-08-31 11:38:17	False	False

B13Q8trnAW6	*Three tips when making the switch*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Today has been extra fun! Lunch with a friend and checked out @oasisskin (met founder Hildra who’s wonderful 👋). I still have some bottled haircare (no SLS, but comes in plastic) but the best time to explore a new product is before you run out.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Pre-researching, being prepared, and phasing in is also my strategy for switching from single-use fem care (pantyliners, pads, tampons) to reusable.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Here are my three tips for an easy switch:. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. 1. Start on your last/lightest day:. Start on your lightest day, when you’re kind of just spotting, and work backwards to your heavier days. If you start on a light day, you can try a pantyliner before moving onto a pad for heavier days.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. 2. Phase your switch in:. Don’t think you need to get your complete set of reusable pads all at once. You might like different feels, fabrics and finishes (and there are different ones to choose from, for example I don’t like flannel especially in this weather but some love the feel of it).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. 3. Start at home:. It can be worrying wearing reusables out for the first time, so start your journey when you know you’re going to be relaxing at home. This way you’ll be less stressed as you can go to the loo any time. Monitor your flow and get a feel for how long you want to go between changes. You might also be able to feel the difference between how a cloth pad absorbs and how a disposable absorbs.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. If you have questions please DM me; saying no to plastic pads is a passion and I’m happy to talk about it lots.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #pantyliner #pantyliners #reusablepantyliners #liners #clothpantyliner #clothpad #reusablepad #reusablemenstrualproducts #rumps #reusable #reusables #reusableperiodproducts #zerowaste #zerowasteperiod #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #journeytozerowaste #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #flatlay #consciouschoices #myfavouritethings #prettyperiods #happyperiod #suststainablealternatoves #noplanetb		#pantyliner | #pantyliners | #reusablepantyliners | #liners | #clothpantyliner | #clothpad | #reusablepad | #reusablemenstrualproducts | #rumps | #reusable | #reusables | #reusableperiodproducts | #zerowaste | #zerowasteperiod | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #journeytozerowaste | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #flatlay | #consciouschoices | #myfavouritethings | #prettyperiods | #happyperiod | #suststainablealternatoves | #noplanetb	@oasisskin	46	10	2019-09-01 17:26:28	False	False

B10gL_Gn8Zd	Visited the Singapore night festival last night. Because of the night fest, Substation stayed opened till 11pm and I was able to catch he exhibition 'Rejects'. Featured in the 2nd photo is the installation from the very talented amigurumi artist @kllylmrck. Creative, pretty and sad - for me. Go check out the art pieces and see what feelings they draw out of you. Feel and breathe again. .. Regardless of the valuation of the times, the intrinsic value of any piece of art/effort is unmistakable, awaiting the seeing eye and the perceiving mind. .. Caught unprepared, I did not get any drinks and settled for a late dinner of a turkey burger in my Ofoodin bag. No disposables except for the paper the burger was already sat on. .. If you are checking out the night fest, remember to BYO and spread the message. We don't want disposables! Hope the organisers will consider REUSABLES. Help!

It was my 2nd trip to the vet today in under 48 hours. There wasn’t anything wrong enough with @nanalovesapples but something had been bugging me since Wednesday. We called and fortunately the vet had a cancellation so we took the slot, but it meant needing to make a lot of adjustments to the day. She had a blood test done, an infection of some sort, the vet said it was good that I’d brought her in. Fingers crossed 🤞. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Vet visits mean coffee (yes, coffee!) and though I know that @nyloncoffee is very conscious  to not abuse single-use, I made sure to chuck my @keepcup in my bag. I didn’t need to use it today but took a pic coz the dog print coffee cup strap was quite fitting in this pic.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Please send good juju to Nana.

B1sHm8ZnHmE	*Yesterday’s breakfast in our snack baggies*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. “I think I want a croissant from @tiongbahrubakery, do you want anything?”. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. “No, I don’t think so. I’ll skip.”. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. *A few seconds pass*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. “Oh wait! I’ll have a kouign-amann! Here’s my snack baggie for it.”. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. “What about me? I don’t have a snack baggie. Should I use a bread bag?”. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. 😂🤗🤣💪. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I would have let him use a bread bag too (versatility right?) but I wanted to see if (or how could) a croissant 🥐 fit into my snack baggie, especially a mammoth one from TBB, so I passed him one of my earliest prototypes. @projectbecome lives on 💪💪💪. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Voilà! Breakfast in snack baggies! Their croissant is rather large, and it’s also very straight (some croissants curve into a crescent like this 🥐) so I was right – thé ends might stick out of the corner of the bag, or you could just chomp off the ends immediately (the stomach is a bag 😂😂😂)! Smaller croissants might fit whole... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So lunchbox versus snack baggie. I’d be able to put baked goods into a lunchbox but not soup in a snack baggie. If you look at it that way, the box is more versatile. But personally don’t like carrying lunchboxes with me all the time, so this is good as it’s light and hardly takes up space in my bag.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I don’t believe that zero waste is about restriction or denying yourself. I don’t think it has to be hard either. I believe a zero waste journey is a joyful and fun, paired with conscious choices and responsibility. This is where my #mariekondo kicks in. And whether you choose box or bag, it’s about appreciating the things you have around you and saying “no thanks” to single-use that won’t ever go away.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbaggie #reusablebag #reusablesnackbag #reusablefoodbag #reusablesandwichbag #foodbag #sandwichbag #reusable #reusables #saynotoplasticzipbags #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastefood #zerowasteonthego #breadwithoutbags #byob #bringyourown #bringyourownbag #zerowastezakka		#mariekondo | #snackbag | #snackbaggie | #reusablebag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablefoodbag | #reusablesandwichbag | #foodbag | #sandwichbag | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotoplasticzipbags | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastefood | #zerowasteonthego | #breadwithoutbags | #byob | #bringyourown | #bringyourownbag | #zerowastezakka	@tiongbahrubakery | @projectbecome	62	6	2019-08-28 09:33:12	False	False
B1pjFwOn-MY	*A 🌈 of pantyliners 💛💛💛*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Pantyliners are one of the easiest things to switch from disposable to reusable. It’s low risk, easy to wash, and so much more comfy than single-use.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. • Why low risk? •. Liners are designed to be worn on your lightest days or daily. Because they’re not for heavier days, you won’t risk a stain on your butt anyway. Once you see how easy it is, switching things up for other days will be easier.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. • Easy care •. Sometimes there are stains. I’ve noticed over time, the fabric yellows slightly, this is normal. What’s good about my liners and pads is that the inner side (that comes into context with your skin) is made from *unbleached* cotton so it is a light wheat, natural colour. This is very forgiving. I chose unbleached cotton as that’s kindest to your skin. They machine wash and dry just fine, but will probably last longer if you line dry. I double wash mine, first with bar soap in the shower, then in the with the rest of my laundry 🧺 .. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. *Soooo comfortable*. My gynaecologist gave me the thumbs up for replacing commercial disposable liners with an all-cotton fabric alternative. It makes sense.

B1nFIZ2HTBx	*Always prepared to refuse single-use while on the go*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. @shabeariekill first reached out to me, enquiring about the snack baggie. And then she asked for something to hold her collapsible lunchbox (and I’m guess upright especially when full). The conversation turned to a furokishi wrap (風呂敷 in Japanese, bao fok in Cantonese, or 包布 bāo bù in Mandarin). She also decided to get a coffee cup strap for her collapsible cup.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I love the furokishi wrap cloth because it’s so versatile and I’m a big fan of multi-purpose uses. Besides the round @seastainable.co collapsible silicone bowl that Sha planned to use this primarily for, it doubles as a shopping bag, a bread bag, or a produce bag; it works amazingly for various shapes and sizes. Being prepared means more stuff to carry around but you can be smart with which items! There are a multitude of decorative knots and styles to choose from though I usually end up choosing from a basic three (and this is probably one of the simplest).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These will be leaving my studio today and going to their new home with Sha. I hope they’ll spark lots of joy and be a ready help in our journey to reduce single-use 💛🤗💪. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbaggie #reusablebag #reusablesnackbag #reusablefoodbag #reusablesandwichbag #reusablecoffeecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeetogo #coffeeonthego #zerowastecoffee #baofok #baobu #wrappingcloth #furokishi #wrap #wrapbag #reusable #reusables #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #flatlay		#snackbag | #snackbaggie | #reusablebag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablefoodbag | #reusablesandwichbag | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeetogo | #coffeeonthego | #zerowastecoffee | #baofok | #baobu | #wrappingcloth | #furokishi | #wrap | #wrapbag | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #flatlay	@shabeariekill | @seastainable.co	65	6	2019-08-26 10:35:21	False	False
B1ko9ZkFjYC	Vadai or Wadeh - a fried, savoury Indian snack.. Haven't had one in ages, so upon spotting this Eral Vadai akin to a prawn fritter at Changi Airport, we had to grab a few to-go in my #byo Alice in Wonderland @tuneemanee snack-bag. So handy! If only the Chana Dal Vada was available too, we would have gotten a handful..... .. No regrets though, as this prawn fritter was moreish and addictive.

B1iie6bnSwW	*33°C (real feel 38°C), I want a good coffee, and I usually have my reusable coffee cup with me*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Except that today, I forgot. The @keepcup in this picture. Which I had taken out and promptly... forgot 🤦‍♀️. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Because my studio’s at home, when I go out, I’ll pretty much always have a nice coffee somewhere, and in this heat, an iced white would be awesome.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Everyone with the best of intentions will forget their reusable cup or something at some point. Generally if i forget my cup, I’ll do one of three things - have a hot coffee at the cafe, go without, or try to get my coffee in another receptacle (Joe & Dough have been very accommodating and put my iced latte in my water bottle). Today, I have a fourth option – I can check out @revolv.io since they’re there with their #tiongbahrutakeover and find out how their work!. ou forget like. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B1gf13NHtav	What do you know about your food? Do you know where it was grown or raised? Who harvested it and if that person was paid a fair wage? Or if part of a rainforest was demolished to make room for your beef, soy, coffee, cocoa or palm oil? 🤷🏻‍♀️. .. .. .. I’m sure you are aware of what is going on in the Amazon and it has been difficult for me to find the words to convey a positive, actionable message, but I’m going to try! ➡️. .. .. .. First, I am not Brazilian and only know of the political climate based upon what I learn from foreign publications. That being said, what I know best is what I can do at home; I can voice my concern to my own government reps and demand that they take action (for ex. Macron is urging G7 members-🇨🇦🇫🇷🇩🇪🇮🇹🇯🇵🇺🇸🇬🇧-to put this issue at the top of the agenda). .. .. .. .. Other things I can do from home are: to make a donation (@rainforestalliance, @wwf @amazonwatch are a few), educate others and offer support in anyway I can. I also recently downloaded  @ecosia, a search engine that plants trees 🌳 .. .. .. .. .. Lastly, it’s important to try to reduce beef consumption, but also keep in mind that JBS has subsidiaries all over the US. They are a majority stakeholder in Pilgrim’s Pride, which is one of the country’s largest poultry providers, with customers such as WalMart, Costco, Publix and even (wait for it) public schools. NOW are you going to tell a kid getting free lunch that may have not eaten otherwise to ‘go vegan?’ No. Can you voice your concern to your local store or school board about switching providers or offering more plant based options? Yes. (I understand it’s a lot more complicated than that, but doing nothing also results in nothing). 🗣.. .. .. .. Personally, I need to be more cognizant of products like coffee and cocoa and not just in Brazil, but in other parts of central and South America. ☕️ All of the information on JBS is public and what is exported to your country is available on the oec.world website. You can also contact a company for answers. If they can’t give them to you, stop buying their products (if you can).

B1gE_T9Hd4Q	*Lovely snack baggies in prints by Beatrice Tan of The Patternholic*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. How utterly gorgeous are these prints from @thepatternholic? 😍🤗🥰 I’m beyond pleased she reached out to me to work on these; I’ve been crushing on her Instagram and you know how I love prints!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. These snack baggies were commissioned by Beatrice and I finished them today. I swear each time I finish something, it’s my new favourite. I really want one for myself but I don’t *need* more snack baggies for my own use (they dry so quickly when I turn them inside out and hand wash with dish soap). It’s a good thing I’m being disciplined as I can’t actually decide whether I like the monsteras or ferns more. The way Beatrice has designed the print, the monsteras look like they have a sheen, which I think the real life green leaves have too. And I like the ferns for its delicacy and the somewhat unusual ample white space which gives it a relaxed feel. Which do you prefer? Leave a comment from me below! 👍😍🤗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. What are you plans this weekend? I’ll be in Tiong Bahru and thought I’d check out @revolv.io’s #tiongbahrutakeover – I’m thinking perhaps some shortbread which will fit nicely in my snack baggie (mine’s an Asanoha with a slight fabric defect) but it’ll depend on what else there is at @plainvanilla!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B1dnKcgHixm	*Every little counts*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Some days, I go through the “Is what I’m doing even making a difference?” My mind wondered to the thought of whether I’ll see a post apocalyptic future in my lifetime and that was a extremely uncomfortable thought.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I countered that thought with a more empowering one. I read Stephen Covey’s The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People a few years ago and remembered the circle of influence vs. the circle of concern (swipe 👈, if you want details, google – note: lowercase g – it on @ecosia).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Climate change and its effects – that’s a big, looming concern and I, as an individual, can’t single-handedly change it. So it sits in my circle of concern. But if I break the mammoth problem into smaller bits, I’m able to move chunks into my circle of influence, and it’s here that I can effect change 💪. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m trying to get my parents to reduce their single-use take out containers and cutlery. Sometimes it feels like an uphill battle and they probably won’t be around to experience the climate catastrophe. I explain, I ask, I nag, I plead. But I can’t actually change their minds for them. But my own actions with them must make a difference, no matter how small. I’m moving what I can’t control into smaller chunks that I am able to influence. Even this post has a secondary target audience – my parents follow me 🤗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Thank you @aeri.lynn for getting your snack baggie and Stojo strap from me. I know you’re exploring options for more of your journey to zero waste and I’m really excited to be part of it! 💛🙏😍. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbaggie #reusablebag #reusablesnackbag #reusablefoodbag #reusablesandwichbag #foodbag #sandwichbag #reusable #reusables #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastefood #flatlay #reusablecoffeecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeetogo #coffeeonthego #zerowastecoffee #tinkerboxinthewild		#snackbag | #snackbaggie | #reusablebag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablefoodbag | #reusablesandwichbag | #foodbag | #sandwichbag | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastefood | #flatlay | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeetogo | #coffeeonthego | #zerowastecoffee | #tinkerboxinthewild	@ecosia | @aeri.lynn	51	1	2019-08-22 18:20:19	False	False
B1a26YWHQmG	*My BYO arsenal for a rather rare day out*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Today is a day out for me, and I won’t be home till after dinner at my parents’. I started by dropping @nanalovesapples off with her grandpawrents, then heading to lunch with @shllspngt, coffee at @nexuscoffeesg (swipe 👈👈) who supports #byo, then to @justwannachill2019 (we kept missing each other), a little walk with @bejoyfulalways to pick up some ribbon she was letting go of, then to the BYOC (#bringyourowncup) initiative with @takejust_enough and team. Finally home (well my parents’), what a day! I try to plan my trips to town strategically to maximise my time out! 👍💪🙏🥵. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My reusables arsenal for the day: I had my 750ml water bottle with me and I finished the water (today is a 🤬🔥📅), was happily surprised when I found out @nexuscoffeesg gives you 20 cents off when you bring your own cup, and I considered getting some @famousamossg cookies 🍪 because I had my snack baggie with me but the heat said no.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. What do you guys think about helping compile a list of coffeeshops that offer a discount when bringing your own? I don’t go to the Central Business District often enough to do it but will happily help compiling (I love Google Sheets)!

B1XiihHHw05	*But first coffee*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Coffee in the morning is my ritual, it doesn’t stimulate me or keep me awake. I just love good coffee.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. In previous working lives, I used to buy coffee in disposable cups every day. Coffee was my psychological defence against what lurked behind enemy lines. I started using my Keepcup for water because I didn’t want to use tiny styrofoam cups big enough for two gulps of water, and serendipitously discovered @starbuckssg gives a 50-cent discount for BYO, which means that every 10-12 cups gives me a free coffee. Who can argue with that?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. While coffee isn’t heavy, holding up a coffee cup can be annoying – if you have to walk a long distance (I walked 30 min every morning) or if you have other things to hold (and everyone has a zillion things to hold these days, with a multitude of tech in our bags and our lives on our phones). Not to mention an arsenal of #byo!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My coffee cup strap comes in handy to free up some hand real estate. They work with any cup that has a removable band such as the #Keepcup, @Stojo, #Solcups, @revolv.io, to name a few. They’ll work with other silicone cups and bamboo fibre cups (though please avoid the bamboo fibre - formaldehyde from the binding resin leaches into drinks at temperatures above 70°C). I might ask you to check the specific dimensions of your cup though I’ve now got a pretty good handle (funny but no pun intended 🤣🤣🤣) on sizing.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Click on #tinkerboxinthewild to see how some other people are liking their coffee cup straps as well as other things. And if you have a strap from me, please tag me! 🙏🙏🙏. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B1VmChunSFM	*My favourite things”. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. Bright copper kettles and warm woollen mittens. Brown paper packages tied up with strings . These are a few of my favourite things.... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I love the song My Favourite Things from my absolute, longtime favourite film The Sound of Music (I know every song and I’ve seen it more than 50 times) so when Mariya from @lickthefrosting selected fabric designs for her liners, I had an inkling that these were some of the things she loves (especially since she’s half of two sisters’ attempt to create magic out of butter, flour, and sugar, and who can argue with cake and cookies) 🍪🍩🍰🧁🥧. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. From top right to bottom left:. Teapots and teacups on red; blue green monstera leaves; garden herbs like basil and rosemary; cupcakes #becausecupcake; and little airplanes ✈️ 💛😍. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I love how the little things that we choose say big things about our hobbies, personality, beliefs. In addition to showing the things that we love, choosing a reusable pantyliner says “I know it’s a little less convenient than discarding because I’ll need to wash it. But I *choose* comfort, health and to do my part to positively impact climate change.” Because every little counts.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #pantyliner #pantyliners #reusablepantyliners #liners #clothpantyliner #clothpad #reusablepad #reusablemenstrualproducts #rumps #reusable #reusables #climatechangeactions #reusableperiodproducts #zerowaste #zerowasteperiod #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #journeytozerowaste #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #saynotodisposables #zerowasteinspo #flatlay #consciouschoices #myfavouritethings #prettyperiods #happyperiod		#becausecupcake | #pantyliner | #pantyliners | #reusablepantyliners | #liners | #clothpantyliner | #clothpad | #reusablepad | #reusablemenstrualproducts | #rumps | #reusable | #reusables | #climatechangeactions | #reusableperiodproducts | #zerowaste | #zerowasteperiod | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #journeytozerowaste | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #saynotodisposables | #zerowasteinspo | #flatlay | #consciouschoices | #myfavouritethings | #prettyperiods | #happyperiod	@lickthefrosting	47	4	2019-08-19 15:36:35	False	False

B1TqQZdHNuS	*Unpaper wipes against stains and spills on my kitchen counter top*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. When I was choosing kitchen countertops, I made the mistake of selecting white. I really wanted an all white flat because the space is tiny, but it’s difficult to maintain. It’s much easier for one person (me) to keep it clean since I know what needs to be done and I take care to do it, but other people frequently don’t understand why I treat every spill with great urgency and importance. (I’d really like to change out my countertops to something requiring less care but that’s a different story 😉.). ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So I have a wipe that sits on top my kitchen sink faucet for these annoying little drips and spots that can’t be avoided.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Tea is a big annoyance (coffee’s easier to clean) as its tannins stain everything! If I don’t wipe spilled tea off the counter immediately, it’ll take more time, chemicals and elbow grease to remove.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. In my family, we don’t use paper towels for eating surfaces. We use unpaper towel wipes called a “toi bo” in Cantonese. The direct translation “table cloth” “does not do it justice. I’m not even sure what the Mandarin translation is, as I’ve never heard the phrase in anything other than Cantonese 🤣😂😅. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Whatever you use, skip the disposable paper towel! And it’s not difficult to wash; if I spill curry, milk or anything sugary, it gets thoroughly hand washed immediately and set aside for the next load of  household linens for the washing machine.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. And with that, I’ve spent far too long talking about my kitchen and my wipes 🤣🤣🤣. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ##unpapertowel #unpapertowels #clothwipes #reusablecloth #reusablewipes #unpapers #reusablecloths #reusables #reusable #cloth #cloths #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo #zerowastehacks #zerowastelifehacks #zerowastecloths. saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reducingwaste #zerowastegram #flaylay #cleankitchen #reusablekitchenwipes		#unpapertowel | #unpapertowels | #clothwipes | #reusablecloth | #reusablewipes | #unpapers | #reusablecloths | #reusables | #reusable | #cloth | #cloths | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastehacks | #zerowastelifehacks | #zerowastecloths | #saynotodisposables | #reducingwaste | #zerowastegram | #flaylay | #cleankitchen | #reusablekitchenwipes		49	8	2019-08-18 21:34:57	False	False

B1Lf2fGnJzL	*Unpaper towel wipes – in a brand new size*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. A couple of weeks ago, I did some dipstick consumer research and asked you guys about your unpaper towel usage patterns in order as I was thinking of sizing down from full paper towel size. I felt that I could size down because cotton cloth is more absorbant than paper, so that it would feel better in your hand and be less fiddly.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. While I say this research was dipstick, i have spent a lot of time talking to you guys and understanding your needs and usage patterns. There was about a 50-50 split between wiping and saving the wipe for reuse, and wiping and setting it aside for wash; slightly more people said you’d hand wash as you go than saving a batch and bulk washing; and most say that cleaning surfaces and wiping up small spills are more frequent than mopping up big spills!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So here are the new unpaper towel wipes! They’re about an inch bigger all around an adult hand 🖐 (give or take depending on hand size). I think this will provide enough absorbency for everyday surface wiping and the occasional spill, while being small enough to dry in between wipes, especially if you hand wash on the go. They’ll also make really good on-the-go wipes 🤗🤗🤗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My favourite  way of storing unpaper towels has to be the “tissue paper accordion fold.” I have a reusable tissue box that I bought for my reusables, and with this fold, as I take one sheet out of the box, the next sheet pulls out automatically. They’re really easy to fold too!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #unpapertowel #unpapertowels #clothwipes #reusablecloth #reusablewipes #unpapers #reusablecloths #reusables #reusable #cloth #cloths #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo #zerowastehacks #zerowastelifehacks #zerowastecloths. saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reducingwaste #zerowastegram #flaylay		#unpapertowel | #unpapertowels | #clothwipes | #reusablecloth | #reusablewipes | #unpapers | #reusablecloths | #reusables | #reusable | #cloth | #cloths | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowastehacks | #zerowastelifehacks | #zerowastecloths | #saynotodisposables | #reducingwaste | #zerowastegram | #flaylay		82	4	2019-08-15 17:30:06	False	False

B1IyKI8H23f	*Breakfast to go*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. What’s your typical brekkie? Mine is coffee. And I usually have a latte. Today I made myself a golden turmeric latte (with coffee, because sometimes a turmeric latte is just milk and turmeric, who really knows) and had some cherries because I’d already taken them out as props for this photo 😂😂😂. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. When I worked in an agency, I’d frequently take cut fruit to work that I’d eat mid morning, and stuff that I’d baked for an afternoon snack (pictured in the shark snack baggie: cookie brownies or crownies; Google ‘crownies Chubby Hubby’ for the recipe 😋), and always coffee. Coffee is my ritual even if it doesn’t keep me awake.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. My snack baggies are lined with a certified food safe liner that’s water and grease proof. It’s also really easy to wash. If you’re in the office, you can simply flip it inside out and use a little dish washing liquid  and leave to air dry. As long as you keep the outer dry, it’ll dry in under an hour, ready for the next snack before the day is over!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. And if you’re a person who grabs brekkie in the way to work or school, grab it in a snack baggie and reusable coffee cup with a coffee cup strap to keep your hands free for other things!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbaggie #reusablebag #reusablesnackbag #reusablefoodbag #reusablesandwichbag #foodbag #sandwichbag #reusable #reusables #saynotoplasticzipbags #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteonthego #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastefood #flatlay #keepcup #reusablecoffeecup #coffeecupstrap #coffeetogo #coffeeonthego #zerowastecoffee #breadwithoutbags		#snackbag | #snackbaggie | #reusablebag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablefoodbag | #reusablesandwichbag | #foodbag | #sandwichbag | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotoplasticzipbags | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastefood | #flatlay | #keepcup | #reusablecoffeecup | #coffeecupstrap | #coffeetogo | #coffeeonthego | #zerowastecoffee | #breadwithoutbags		78	10	2019-08-14 16:12:21	False	False

B1AuMirntyD	*Hungry 30 minutes early!*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Weekends always screw up my eating schedule. During the week, I typically have coffee for breakfast, lunch between 12 and 1, and dinner. On weekends, I tend to have brunch (a little earlier) and dinner a little later.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Last night just before a planned dinner with friends at 8, I got really hungry (about 30 minutes before dinner)! I was really tempted to get some fried mushrooms even though dinner was in half an hour! And I would have too, had I had my snack baggie with me 😋😋😋 So it might not have been a bad thing that I didn’t ruin my dinner with my pre-dinner.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. At dinner, we got cocktails 🍸. Towards the end though, I was really thirsty and wanted water, but the establishment does not serve tap water (you have to buy bottled water). After dinner, we looked for a place for drinks. The first place we sat down at didn’t serve tap water either (and considering we were ordering alcohol, serving tap water should be a socially responsible thing to do). The only other occupied was extremely loud so we left and went somewhere else that did serve water, which was great because I was so thirsty.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. But I’m really not talking about my dinner or drinks. I’m reflecting on how badly prepared I was yesterday and wondering why some food and beverage establishments don’t serve water (just tap will do, this is Singapore and it’s perfectly safe).. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Aside from us as individuals bring prepared with our arsenal of reusables, wouldn’t it be great if the food industry helped reduce single-use PET bottled water? I’ll gladly buy a coffee or an espresso martini!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #snackbag #snackbaggie #reusablebag #reusablesnackbag #reusablefoodbag #reusablesandwichbag #foodbag #sandwichbag #reusable #reusables #saynotoclingwrap #saynotoplasticzipbags #saynotosingleuse #saynotosingleuseplastic #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesnacking #zerowasteonthego #zerowastehacks #zerowasteinspo #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastefood #flatlay #eco		#snackbag | #snackbaggie | #reusablebag | #reusablesnackbag | #reusablefoodbag | #reusablesandwichbag | #foodbag | #sandwichbag | #reusable | #reusables | #saynotoclingwrap | #saynotoplasticzipbags | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotosingleuseplastic | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesnacking | #zerowasteonthego | #zerowastehacks | #zerowasteinspo | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastefood | #flatlay | #eco		51	3	2019-08-11 13:03:48	False	False
B076Zg6HejO	*Happy National Day and Hari Raya, happy long weekend, and happy me! 🤗*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Yay! It’s the long weekend! I’m still going to be working (sewing) this weekend but I have got a few lovely little things planned!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Tonight, I’ve a veggie 🥗 dinner date with @eco_le_sg (I’m making a hearty salad; check today’s Stories for what kind), tomorrow some drinks with friends, and a ‘maker meetup’ over coffee and fabric with @thepatternholic on Sunday (I simply adore her designs)! Now let’s see about Monday!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. The last few days have been crazy and I haven’t had much time to sew, so I’m really happy that these pantyliners are done and ready to go! @pokzilla and @stellayun – coming your way! Thank you for your patience! I can’t wait till you receive them.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Remember the strawberry 🍓on pink fabric fabric (swipe 👈👈) from a couple of posts ago? This pattern seemed to be a popular one. Unfortunately, the supplier has sold out and I only had half a yard. And now, after orders placed for items in this print, I have just enough for *one snack baggie* just ☝️ just one. If you’d like to lay your hands on it, send me a DM!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀.

B02QlbsH8Op	*My gynaecologist approves 👍👍👍*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. 2 years ago, I went private after public health failed to resolve excruciating period pain; part of the diagnosis was Nabothian cysts and minor infections. Over the course of a year and two rounds of suppositories, it hadn’t really improved.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Yesterday I went for my annual scans and my doc was happy that my condition improved. He asked if I’d used the douche (internal wash) he prescribed and I said that I decided not to. Then he asked what I’ve been doing differently and that whatever it was, it was working! 🤗. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I told him I’d stopped wearing commercial disposable period products. He said, “Pantyliners, oh good.” He said that they restrict airflow and have a tendency to cause bacterial growth. He also recommended cotton underwear.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. If you want to see what a commercial disposable pantyliner is made of, check out my Story Highlights where I cut one up and peeled apart its layers.  The waterproof layer is a thin plastic film – traps moisture and heat, and encourages bacterial growth. And If you want to read about the toxicity of commercial disposable menstrual products, head over to the Linktree link in my bio and scroll to the bottom.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’m really pleased to say that my pads and #pantyliners are made from 100% cotton fabric. The pretty printed side is designed to face your undies, and the side that touches your skin is unbleached cotton. A light fabric can stain but unbleached cotton is forgiving as it’s naturally beige. I also share real time photos and videos that show it’s possible to keep staining at bay. Go check it out 💛🤗👌. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #reusablepads #reusables #clothpads #pads #rumps #ecofriendlypads #reusablepantyliners #pantyliner #zerowasteliving #zerowastesingapore #zerowastesg #zerowastemovement #zerowastelife #zerowasteperiods #zerowasteperiod #zerowastelifestyle #zerowastejourney #reusable #saynotosingleuse #flatlay #saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #saynotosingleuseplastics #happyperiod #plasticfreeperiod #plasticfree		#pantyliners | #reusablepads | #reusables | #clothpads | #pads | #rumps | #ecofriendlypads | #reusablepantyliners | #pantyliner | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowastesg | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastelife | #zerowasteperiods | #zerowasteperiod | #zerowastelifestyle | #zerowastejourney | #reusable | #saynotosingleuse | #flatlay | #saynotosingleuse | #saynotodisposables | #saynotosingleuseplastics | #happyperiod | #plasticfreeperiod | #plasticfree		59	8	2019-08-07 11:32:39	False	False
B0zyHVyH1DK	*Using reusables*. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Here’s a stack of unpaper towels @i23han ordered in a variety of pretty prints. What can you use them for? There is no one answer and if there were, it’d be “anything you’d use kitchen paper towel for, and then some.”. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. @teoyanru uses her full sized ones a lot on-the-go to replace pocket tissue (single-use that comes in plastic film packaging), @urbanhikers uses hers for everything around the house, @3mm.montessori and so many other #montessoriparents have the minis for their kids to help out around the house (and they’re not so mini that many adult hands would find too fiddly). I use them in lieu of oven mitts or when I want to make sure my mixing bowl doesn’t spin when I’m making something. Such possibilities 🤗!. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. I’ve been making full sized unpaper towels (similar to the commercial disposable kitchen towel) and minis (about 14x14 cm). Because they’re cloth, they absorb better than paper towel so you don’t need such a big square. At pop-ups, the minis seem to be more popular than the regular sized ones too.. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. So what do you think of an in-between size – roughly 17x21 cm? Answers to my burning questions would help me make something for you that works:. • Do you wipe, save the cloth and wipe again or put it in the laundry basket immediately after using?. • Do you hand wash kitchen wipes as you go, or save up and do a load in the machine when it’s laundry day?. • Do you find yourself using your cloth wipes damp (but not wet) for example, wiping down surfaces, or mopping up spillages?. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Please feel free to leave a comment below or answer in my Stories! Thank you for sharing your thoughts 💛💛. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. #unpapertowel #unpapertowels #clothwipes #reusablecloth #reusablewipes #unpapers #reusablecloths #reusables #reusable #cloth #cloths #zerowaste #zerowastesg #zerowastesingapore #zerowasteliving #zerowastemovement #zerowastejourney zerowastelife #zerowastekitchen #zerowasteswaps #zerowasteinspo . saynotosingleuse #saynotodisposables #reducingwaste #igsg #zerowastegram		#montessoriparents | #unpapertowel | #unpapertowels | #clothwipes | #reusablecloth | #reusablewipes | #unpapers | #reusablecloths | #reusables | #reusable | #cloth | #cloths | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #zerowastesingapore | #zerowasteliving | #zerowastemovement | #zerowastejourney | #zerowastekitchen | #zerowasteswaps | #zerowasteinspo | #saynotodisposables | #reducingwaste | #igsg | #zerowastegram	@i23han | @teoyanru | @urbanhikers | @3mm.montessori	58	2	2019-08-06 12:27:55	False	False

B83QG5wFfQ_	The bamboo straw is light so it's easy to carry it around, and it's good because you don't have to break easily if you drop it. It's good for adults and children. Instead of disposable plastic straws that you use once and throw away, take bamboo straws out of your pouch anytime, anywhere.. . You can wash it lightly in water when you're in a cafe or outside. When it's difficult to clean it, you can shake off all the remaining water from the bamboo straw and bring it home with a pouch and wash it with a natural straw cleaning brush.. . It's not hard. The world may change one day with only a little bit of our effort. Try a bamboo straw with us. I highly recommend bamboo straws to you who will love the Earth and soon love the Earth more. 🌏. .

B80VTj5FQ6F	Bamboo is a safe, natural alternative that doesn't endanger marine life or pollute the environment. ... ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Bamboo fibers have natural antimicrobial properties meaning they are less likely to harbor bacteria over time and be more resistant to spoiling or rotting over time. Bamboo is also grown chemical-free, not requiring the need for chemical fertilizers or pesticides. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀. Bamboo straws are the ONLY compostable reusable straw on the market. When your straws show natural signs of wear and tear such as splitting or fraying at the ends, it’s time to dispose of them. Rather than throwing them in the garbage, you can simply compost them in soil allowing them to decompose and return to the earth.⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ Go ahead and bring them in your home!

B8xLW9hnsaF	BYO Essentials 🌿. We personally prefer to drink beverages without using straws and straight from the cup. But we know that everyone have their own preferences on how they like to consume their drinks.. . People have shared with us why they simply cannot give up the straw. Reasons such as:. 1) Having sensitive teeth. 2) Being a Bubble tea lover. 3) Afraid of staining their teeth. 4) Having disability. . Have other reasons? Share it with us!. . PS: Remember to make a commitment to use the reusable straws once you get them! 😊. .. .. .. .. #sustainable #sustainability #zerowaste #zerowastesg #sustainableliving #sustainablesingapore #byo #reusablestraw #nubobluewhalestraw #supportlocal		#sustainable | #sustainability | #zerowaste | #zerowastesg | #sustainableliving | #sustainablesingapore | #byo | #reusablestraw | #nubobluewhalestraw | #supportlocal		8	2	2020-02-20 08:21:56	False	False

BkyACLFgcOK	[Eng below]. .. 🇭🇷Evo kako ja osobno nastojim koristiti manje štetne plastike tijekom mjesečnice. Ako se pitate zašto, mnogo se plastike proizvodi i troši na to a ne može se reciklirati nakon upotrebe. . Na slici su moja Me Luna čašica iz Müllera i razgradivi ulošci iz dm-a. Ulošci su isti kao i obični, sve upiju i nema problema s njima. No čašica je problematična. Za nju trebate vremena i volje, kao i strpljenja. Umeče se kao i tampon (savije pa otvori iznutra) no to zahtjeva vježbe da bi išlo glatko, obično par mjesečnica. Rade se od silikona i traju godinama, tako stvarajući manje otpada. . Ima i drugih alternativa, za svakoga ponešto. Samo morate potražiti😁. .. .. 🇺🇸🇬🇧. My insta crashed last time I tried to post this. 😤. Here are the products I use to be a more environmentally-friendly uterus owner. My #melunacup from Müller and biodegradeable organic cotton pads from dm, both of which I've tried. The pads are as usual, they absorb everything, nothing particular about them. But the cup is something I got after so many people online being so positive about it. And while it does to its job and hold things in, it demands a lot of time, trial and error, confusion, touching and sometimes discomfort. It's made of silicon and lasts for years with good care, creating less waste in the process.. There are many other alternatives and there is something for everyone😁. .. .#menstrualcup #menstruation #uterus #plasticfreeperiods #plasticwaste #plasticfreejuly #plasticfree #plasticfreemonth #noplastic #noplasticplease #biodegradeableplastic #biodegradablepads #zerowaste #zerowastecroatia #zerowastehrvatska #melunacup		#melunacup | #menstrualcup | #menstruation | #uterus | #plasticfreeperiods | #plasticwaste | #plasticfreejuly | #plasticfree | #plasticfreemonth | #noplastic | #noplasticplease | #biodegradeableplastic | #biodegradablepads | #zerowaste | #zerowastecroatia | #zerowastehrvatska | #melunacup		25	2	2018-07-04 03:28:45	False	False

BjhsCVzFNqh	What's in my bag 💁🏻👜 every now and then I make it a point to show my family & friends that it's everyone's responsibility to play a role in reducing carbon footprint and waste (This including food! You know what I'm talking about 😒 knowing you can't finish but still refuse to ask for lesser because there's no discount - would rather throwing and wasting the food 😡) on a daily basis. This started when I realised how many plastic bags I was collecting and accumulating from grocery shoppings. So I decided to bring my own big sturdy reusable bag from sport direct whenever I head down to the supermarket. It's easy to incorporate the habit into your daily lifestyle. Also, you don't need to buy anything fancy like everyone else, just be creative and use what you already have at home. So far I've bought the #stainlesssteelstraws (from lazada) #collapsibletuperware (from lazada) - for easy day to day storage in my handbag and ONE #producebag (by simple cotton from the green collective at One KM mall), everything else is from my stash! I get the organic cotton tote bag from my Bali trip last year at #downtoearthcafe the stainless steel chopstick was from Japan home, which is also housing my straws. Insulated coffee cup purchased from cotton on many years back, never really use it until recently, it's now my daily coffee cup and my favourite coffee stall uncle would give me a 10cents discount 🤑🤑🤑 GO WAtCH 👉 A Plastic Ocean. If you don't already know, our marine life is suffering from the plastic pollution, getting trapped in fishing nets &  plastics. And turtles 🐢 are mistaken plastic for jelly fish as food! 😡 and what's worse? These plastic don't really degrade, it only gets to breakdown to a smaller component calls #microplastics in hundreds years depending on the type of plastic and GUESS WHAT?

BhRIiZshyUc	This one became one of my favorite space in Singapore. I like the idea of their Eco Friendly Branding ideas ; cutleries, food packaging and biodegradable cups. But, it will be much better purpose than just a branding if they use a real mug, use a real plate for dine in instead of using those disposable. Btw, did you spot my @keepcup ?💕. .. .. i will definitely break down those photos into my feed, i can't help their aesthetic space.. .. .. #reusable #keepcup #zerowaste #zerowasteindonesia #sustainablility #sustainableliving  #bringyourown #reusable  #noplasticplease #nolsampah #gerakannolsampah #zerowaste #zerowasteindonesia #zerowastesg #plasticfree		#reusable | #keepcup | #zerowaste | #zerowasteindonesia | #sustainablility | #sustainableliving | #bringyourown | #reusable | #noplasticplease | #nolsampah | #gerakannolsampah | #zerowaste | #zerowasteindonesia | #zerowastesg | #plasticfree	@keepcup	66	2	2018-04-07 19:33:57	False	False
