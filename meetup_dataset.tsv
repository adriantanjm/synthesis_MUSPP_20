About this Event. Spe. We understand that climate change is real and that bold action is needed urgently. But yet so many of us find it so hard to change even the smallest of our behaviors and habits.. . Why?. . One of the main barrier blocking us from making the change in our lifestyle is that we DON’T BELIEVE we can. Sometimes, the change may seem overwhelming like giving up the car or eating less meat. Or it may even feel counter-intuitive; like when we hear the mantra 'less is more' or when we are told to pay a premium for eco-friendly or organic products. And when we look around and we see friends and loved ones going about their lives as if it was business as usual, it is not surprising that we invariably stick our heads back into our little holes and continue living our un-environmentally aligned lives.. . We believe that to change our behavior, we need to first change our beliefs ! And to change our beliefs, we need new stories. Stories that we tell one another and more importantly stories that we tell ourselves. And when these stories are relatable and authentic, we will begin to believe that we can make the change too !. . Join us for a day of inspiring stories of everyday people who have made change REAL in their lives and in their communities.. . The event is jointly organised by Mother Earth & Thomson Toastmasters as well as J.O.E. Alliance; with venue kindly sponsored by YNTUC.

Register here: https://tinyurl.com/y5vphdmk. . Description below from Eventbrite:. . Join us for an exciting evening and the chance to interact with our experts!. . About this Event. Climate change and sea level rise in particular poses an existential threat to many low-lying coastal cities in Southeast Asia, including Singapore. As our world’s oceans get warmer and ice melt in Greenland and the Antarctica continue, sea levels in the Southeast Asian region could rise by up to about 1 metre by the end of the century. Singapore must be prepared for the rising sea levels, “a challenge which needs to be treated with utmost seriousness – similar to how we treat the Singapore Armed Forces”, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in his 2019 National Day Rally speech.. . The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) latest Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate is therefore timely. This seminal report on how the earth’s oceans and cryosphere have been impacted by climate change – e.g. glaciers, ice sheets and ice bergs, will provide useful insights on what such changes mean for people around the world and how can we respond to these challenges to ensure a sustainable future.. . The Symposium gathers a panel of experts, both local and from the IPCC, for a lively exchange on the following topics:. . • Key findings of the Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate. . • Implications of sea level rise in Southeast Asia and Singapore.. . • Insights on challenges Singapore and our region will face from adapting to climate change and sea level rise. . • What we can do to address such challenges effectively.. .

'Tigers of the World Lecture' features six speakers who will share their knowledge and conservation experience of five tiger subspecies.. Bonus Movie Screening: Tigers of the Emerald Forest.. . Date: July 14th, Sunday. Time: 2:00 p.m. – 6:00 p.m.. Venue: The Projector. #05-00 Golden Mile Tower. 6001 Beach Road. S199589. *Free admission, registration required.. . This event is organised by SWAG (Singapore Wildcat Action Group).. . PLEASE REGISTER WITH SWAG USING THIS LINK:. https://wildcatsoftheworld3.peatix.com/event/727660. . Tigers used to roam abundantly in many Asian countries, including densely forested Singapore. Sadly, when the last wild tiger was shot on 26th October, 1930, in Choa Chu Kang, the iconic feline officially went extinct in our country. Deforestation, urbanization, and rampant hunting and poaching continue to decimate the population of the tiger: In the span of 30 years, the world lost three of the nine tiger subspecies. The current global population of wild tigers is estimated to be about 3,000 and the future of this beautiful animal remains fragile.. . It is against this backdrop of urgency that we hope Singapore Tiger Week will bring together wildlife experts from around the world to exchange conservation ideas among each other and to inspire and empower the public of Singapore to lend a hand in preserving the tiger.. . Our eminent speakers for this lecture are:. -Suzalinur bin Manja Bidin on the Malayan tiger. -Anak Pattanavibool on the Indo-Chinese tiger. -Wulan Pusparini on the Sumatran tiger. -Feng Limin on the Amur tiger. -Raghu Chundawat on the Bengal tiger. . Join us for the Tigers of the World Lecture to learn about our five extant tiger subspecies from experts. As a bonus to the lecture, the digitally remastered documentary 'Tigers of the Emerald Forest' will be screened and the producer will be in attendance for a post-screening dialogue with the audience.. . Through Singapore Tiger Week 2019, we endeavour to bring about positive change among fellow citizens and residents of Singapore. We hope you will join us in taking these small steps together to make incremental impact on restoring the global tiger population and improving tiger welfare around the world.. .

World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is one of the world’s largest and most experienced independent conservation organisations. Established on 29 April 1961, it was the product of a deep concern held by a few eminent gentlemen who were worried by what they saw happening in our world at that time. Since then, WWF has grown up to be one of the largest environmental organisations in the world.. . Today, we have more than 5 million supporters worldwide; and we are present in more than 100 countries to conserve and protect our natural environment.. . In Singapore, we engage with individuals and organisations towards making a positive change in their lives and business operations. Through our awareness campaigns and outreach activities, we aim to educate individuals from all walks of life on how a simple action can add up to make a big difference to our environment and safeguard the world’s biodiversity. We also work with businesses both locally and within the Asia Pacific region to help them identify sustainable business practices, as well as on how they can reduce their ecological foot print on the planet.

30640064	Environmental-Awareness-and-Action	77	1	260829112	NSS Talk: Why Conservation Matters (Even If Animals Don't Matter to You)	past	2019-04-23 00:50:50	2019-04-24 19:30:00	0	6	10	0	Singapore Sustainability Academy	180 Kitchener Rd	Singapore	Singapore	DATE : Wednesday, 24 Apr 2019. TIME : 7.30pm - 8.30pm. . LOCATION :. Gallery Room, Level 6. Sky Park. Singapore Sustainability Academy (SSA). City Square Mall. 180 Kitchener Road. Singapore[masked]. . REGISTRATION:. https://tinyurl.com/talk-nss. . SYNOPSIS:. . Modern medicine has been with us roughly one hundred years, but evolution has been at work since life began 3.5 billion years ago. Every time we lose a species, we lose something that may affect or potentially benefit us. Even if animals and wild spaces don’t appeal to you, their preservation absolutely should. There will be two thrusts in Peter Allison’s talk. Firstly, how you can be a conservationist and have fun at the same time. Secondly, why conservation matters even if you aren’t interested in animals with a focus around discoveries that are still being made about animals that can have medical or material benefits for us. Examples include the incredible work being done on how elephants avoid cancer, a recent discovery based on dragonfly wings that could create natural anti-bacterial wipes and also how butterflies may hold the clue to invisibility. Though modern medicine have been around for about one hundred years, evolution has been at work for millions of years so there is much we can learn from nature. This talk is organised by Nature Society (Singapore) and A2A Safaris.. . ABOUT THE SPEAKER:. . Peter’s career began in 1994 in South Africa’s well known Sabi-Sands game reserve. Trained by a legendary group of guides he was always set a high bench mark for what a guide should be. By 1996 he was already looking for wilder challenges and moved north, to Botswana’s Okavango Delta. Here he joined the likes of Colin Bell (the founder of Wilderness Safaris) and found a place he still thinks of as home, even when he lives somewhere else). After several years guiding at the famous Mombo camp, Peter became a guide trainer, before setting off again and spending time in some of Namibia’s most remote regions leading guests.
